Azerbaijan's regime is a curious hybrid, in which semi-presidential institutions operate in the larger context of authoritarianism. The author compares formal Constitutional provisions with the practice of politics in the country, suggesting that formal and informal sources of authority come together to enhance the effective powers of the presidency. In addition to the considerable formal powers laid out in the Constitution, Azerbaijan's president also benefits from the support of the ruling party and informal family and patronage networks. LaPorte concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of this symbiosis between formal and informal institutions in Azerbaijan's semi-presidential regime.  }}</ref>

In the first half of the 7th century, [[Caucasian Albania]], as a vassal of the Sasanians, came under nominal Muslim rule due to the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] repulsed both the Sasanians and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] from the [[South Caucasus]] and turned [[Caucasian Albania]] into a vassal state after Christian resistance led by King [[Javanshir]] was suppressed in 667.

Returning to Tehran in the spring of 1795, he assembled a force of some 60,000 cavalries and infantry and in Shawwal Dhul-Qa'da/May, set off for Azarbaijan, intending to conquer the country between the rivers Aras and Kura, formerly under Safavid control. This region comprised a number of khanates of which the most important was ''Qarabagh'', with its capital at Shusha; Ganja, with its capital of the same name; Shirvan across the Kura, with its capital at Shamakhi; and to the north-west, on both banks of the Kura, Christian Georgia (Gurjistan), with its capital at Tiflis.

Since the independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, the [[Politics of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani government]] has taken measures to preserve the environment of Azerbaijan. National protection of the environment accelerated after 2001 when the state budget increased due to new revenues provided by the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline]]. Within four years, protected areas doubled and now make up eight percent of the country's territory. Since 2001 the government has set up seven large reserves and almost doubled the sector of the budget earmarked for environmental protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enrin.grida.no/htmls/azer/soe/ecology/html/ecology.html |title=Ecological problems in Azerbaijan |publisher=Enrin.grida.no |access-date=30 June 2010}}</ref>

Azerbaijan is home to a wide variety of landscapes. Over half of Azerbaijan's landmass consists of [[mountain ridge]]s, [[Mountain crest|crests]], [[highland]]s, and [[plateaus]] which rise up to hypsometric levels of 400–1000&nbsp;meters (including the Middle and Lower lowlands), in some places (Talis, Jeyranchol-Ajinohur and Langabiz-Alat foreranges) up to 100–120&nbsp;meters, and others from 0–50&nbsp;meters and up ([[Qobustan, Absheron]]). The rest of Azerbaijan's terrain consists of plains and lowlands. Hypsometric marks within the Caucasus region vary from about −28&nbsp;meters at the Caspian Sea shoreline up to 4,466&nbsp;meters (Bazardüzü peak).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enrin.grida.no/htmls/azer/soe/ecology/html/ecologicalzones.html |title=Orography of Azerbaijan |publisher= United Nations Environment Programme |access-date=30 June 2010}}</ref>

Rivers and lakes form the principal part of the water systems of Azerbaijan, they were formed over a long geological timeframe and changed significantly throughout that period. This is particularly evidenced by remnants of ancient rivers found throughout the country. The country's water systems are continually changing under the influence of natural forces and human-introduced industrial activities. Artificial rivers (canals) and ponds are a part of Azerbaijan's water systems. In terms of water supply, Azerbaijan is below the average in the world with approximately {{convert|100000|m3|0|abbr=off}} per year of water per square kilometer.<ref name="KL"/> All big [[Reservoir|water reservoirs]] are built on Kur. The hydrography of Azerbaijan basically belongs to the [[Caspian Sea basin]].

The [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura]] and [[Aras River|Aras]] are the major rivers in Azerbaijan. They run through the [[Kura-Aras Lowland]]. The rivers that directly flow into the Caspian Sea, originate mainly from the north-eastern slope of the Major Caucasus and [[Talysh Mountains]] and run along the Samur–Devechi and Lankaran lowlands.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/major-rivers-of-azerbaijan.html |title=Major Rivers Of Azerbaijan |author=Joyce Chepkemoi |date=25 April 2017 |website=worldatlas.com }}</ref>

[[Yanar Dag]], translated as "burning mountain", is a natural gas fire which blazes continuously on a hillside on the [[Absheron Peninsula]] on the [[Caspian Sea]] near [[Baku]], which itself is known as the "land of fire." Flames jet out into the air from a thin, porous sandstone layer. It is a tourist attraction to visitors to the Baku area.<ref>{{cite book| last = Kleveman|first = Lutz|title = The new great game: blood and oil in Central Asia|page=[https://archive.org/details/newgreatgame00lutz/page/15 15]|publisher = Atlantic Monthly Press| year = 2003|url = https://archive.org/details/newgreatgame00lutz| url-access = registration| access-date = November 21, 2010 |isbn=978-0-87113-906-1}}</ref>

The structural formation of Azerbaijan's political system was completed by the adoption of the new [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] on 12 November 1995. According to Article 23 of the Constitution, the [[National symbol|state symbols]] of the Azerbaijan Republic are the [[Flag of Azerbaijan|flag]], the [[Coat of arms of Azerbaijan|coat of arms]], and the [[National Anthem of the Republic of Azerbaijan|national anthem]]. The state power in Azerbaijan is limited only by law for internal issues, but international affairs are also limited by international agreements' provisions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.courts.gov.az/en/main/page/State-power_3056 |title=State power |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=courts.gov.az |access-date=23 November 2020 |archive-date=6 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220806154236/https://courts.gov.az/en/main/page/State-power_3056 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{bsn|date=September 2023}}

The Constitution of Azerbaijan states that it is a presidential republic with three branches of power – Executive, Legislative, and Judicial. The legislative power is held by the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|National Assembly]] and the Supreme National Assembly in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The Parliament of Azerbaijan, called Milli Majlis, consists of 125 deputies elected based on [[first past the post|majority vote]], with a term of five years for each elected member. The elections are held every five years, on the first Sunday of November. The Parliament is not responsible for the formation of the government, but the Constitution requires the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers by Milli Majlis.<ref>(Constitution of Azerbaijan Republic, Articles 104–107)</ref> The [[New Azerbaijan Party]], and independents loyal to the ruling government, currently hold almost all of the Parliament's 125 seats. During the [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010|2010 Parliamentary election]], the opposition parties, [[Musavat]] and [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party]], failed to win a single seat. European observers [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010#Campaign irregularities|found numerous irregularities]] in the run-up to the election and [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010#Election|on election day]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Monitors criticize Azerbaijani elections |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/11/2010118152810836488.html |access-date=8 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111072636/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/11/2010118152810836488.html |archive-date=11 November 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

The executive power is held by the [[President of Azerbaijan|President]], who is elected for a seven-year term by direct elections, and the [[Prime Minister of Azerbaijan|Prime Minister]]. The president is authorized to form the [[Cabinet of Azerbaijan|Cabinet]], a collective executive body accountable to both the President and the National Assembly.<ref name="LaPorte2016" /> The [[Cabinet of Azerbaijan]] consists primarily of the prime minister, his deputies, and ministers. The [[8th Government of Azerbaijan]] is the administration in its current formation. The president does not have the right to dissolve the National Assembly but has the right to veto its decisions. To override the presidential veto, the parliament must have a majority of 95 votes. The judicial power is vested in the [[Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan|Constitutional Court]], [[Supreme Court of Azerbaijan|Supreme Court]], and the Economic Court. The president nominates the judges in these courts.{{cn|date=September 2023}}

Azerbaijan's system of governance nominally can be called two-tiered. The top or highest tier of the government is the Executive Power headed by President. The President appoints the Cabinet of Ministers and other high-ranking officials. The Local Executive Authority is merely a continuation of Executive Power. The Provision determines the legal status of local state administration in Azerbaijan on Local Executive Authority (''Yerli Icra Hakimiyati''), adopted 16 June 1999. In June 2012, the President approved the new Regulation, which granted additional powers to Local Executive Authorities, strengthening their dominant position in Azerbaijan's local affairs<ref>{{cite web |title=Azərbaycan Prezidentinin Rəsmi internet səhifəsi |url=https://president.az/ |website=president.az |language=az}}</ref> The Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution. It was established on 10 April 1997. The administrative department is not a part of the president's office but manages the financial, technical and pecuniary activities of both the president and his office.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://president.az/pages/22/print |title=Təhlükəsizlik Şurası |language=az |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=president.az |access-date=24 November 2020 |archive-date=21 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210721023237/https://president.az/pages/22/print |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The culture of Azerbaijan has developed as a result of many influences; that's why Azerbaijanis are, in many ways, bi-cultural. Today, national traditions are well preserved in the country despite Western influences, including [[globalization|globalized]] consumer culture. Some of the main elements of the Azerbaijani culture are: music, literature, folk dances and art, cuisine, architecture, cinematography and [[Novruz in Azerbaijan|Novruz Bayram]]. The latter is derived from the traditional celebration of the New Year in the ancient Iranian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]]. Novruz is a family holiday.<ref>{{cite web| last = Waters| first = Zena| title = What exactly is Novruz Bayram| publisher = Azerbaijan Today| url = http://www.azerbaijantoday.az/ARCHIVE/12/life1.html| access-date = 22 March 2009| url-status=dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110514214646/http://www.azerbaijantoday.az/ARCHIVE/12/life1.html| archive-date = 14 May 2011}}</ref>

The profile of Azerbaijan's population consists, as stated above, of Azerbaijanis, as well as other nationalities or ethnic groups, compactly living in various areas of the country. Azerbaijani national and traditional dresses are the [[Chokha]] and [[Papakhi]]. There are radio broadcasts in Russian, [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Lezgian language|Lezgian]] and [[Talysh language|Talysh]] languages, which are financed from the state budget.<ref name="MIN"/> Some local radio stations in [[Balakən|Balakan]] and [[Khachmaz (city)|Khachmaz]] organize broadcasts in [[Avar language|Avar]] and [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat]].<ref name="MIN"/> In Baku several newspapers are published in Russian, Kurdish (''Dengi Kurd''), Lezgian (''Samur'') and Talysh languages.<ref name="MIN"/> Jewish society "Sokhnut" publishes the newspaper ''Aziz''.<ref name="MIN"/>

Ashiq combines poetry, storytelling, dance, and vocal and instrumental music into a traditional performance art that stands as a symbol of Azerbaijani culture.

The ''[[Book of Dede Korkut]]'' consists of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century,<ref name="Meeker">Michael E. Meeker, "The Dede Korkut Ethic", International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Aug. 1992), 395–417. excerpt: The Book of Dede Korkut is an early record of oral Turkic folktales in Anatolia, and as such, one of the mythic charters of Turkish nationalist ideology. The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves "Turcoman" rather than "Oghuz," had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen. Some had abandoned their nomadic way of life altogether.</ref> and was not written earlier than the 15th century.<ref name="Kafadar">Cemal Kafadar(1995), "in Between Two Worlds: Construction of the Ottoman states", University of California Press, 1995.

His major works include ''The Divan of Ghazals'' and ''The Qasidas''. In the same century, Azerbaijani literature further flourished with the development of [[Ashik]] ({{lang-az|Aşıq}}) poetic genre of bards.

Azerbaijanis have a rich and distinctive culture, a major part of which is [[decorative art|decorative]] and [[applied art]]. This art form is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jeweling, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone, bone, carpet-making, lasing, pattern weaving and printing, and knitting and embroidery. Each of these types of decorative art, evidence of the endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very much in favor here.

The [[Azerbaijani rug|Azerbaijani carpet]] is a traditional handmade textile of various sizes, with a dense texture and a pile or pile-less surface, whose patterns are characteristic of Azerbaijan's many carpet-making regions.

Azerbaijan has been since ancient times known as a center of a large variety of crafts. The archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well-developed agriculture, stock raising, metalworking, pottery, ceramics, and carpet-weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC.

Azerbaijani carpets can be categorized under several large groups and a multitude of subgroups. Scientific research of the Azerbaijani carpet is connected with the name of [[Latif Karimov]], a prominent scientist and artist.

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported in April 2017 that "Azerbaijan's ruling elite operated a secret $2.9bn (£2.2bn) scheme to pay prominent Europeans, buy luxury goods and launder money through a network of opaque British companies .... Leaked data shows that the Azerbaijani leadership, accused of serial human rights abuses, systemic corruption and rigging elections, made more than 16,000 covert payments from 2012 to 2014. Some of this money went to politicians and journalists, as part of an international lobbying operation to deflect criticism of Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, and to promote a positive image of his oil-rich country."
