'''Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide''' ('''NAD''') is a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|coenzyme]] central to [[metabolism]].<ref>{{Lehninger4th}}</ref> Found in all living [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, NAD is called a dinucleotide because it consists of two [[nucleotide]]s joined through their [[phosphate]] groups. One nucleotide contains an [[adenine]] [[nucleobase]] and the other, [[nicotinamide]]. NAD exists in two forms: an [[Redox|oxidized and reduced]] form, abbreviated as '''NAD{{+}}''' and '''NADH''' (H for [[hydrogen]]), respectively.

In cellular metabolism, NAD is involved in redox reactions, carrying [[electron]]s from one reaction to another, so it is found in two forms: NAD{{+}} is an [[oxidizing agent]], accepting electrons from other molecules and becoming reduced; with H<sup>+</sup>, this reaction forms NADH, which can be used as a [[reducing agent]] to donate electrons. These [[electron transfer]] reactions are the main function of NAD. It is also used in other cellular processes, most notably as a [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] of [[enzyme]]s in adding or removing [[chemical group]]s to or from [[protein]]s, in [[posttranslational modification]]s. Because of the importance of these functions, the enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are targets for [[drug discovery]].

In organisms, NAD can be synthesized from simple building-blocks ([[de novo synthesis|''de novo'']]) from either [[tryptophan]] or [[aspartic acid]], each a case of an [[amino acid]]. Alternatively, more complex components of the coenzymes are taken up from nutritive compounds such as [[niacin]]; similar compounds are produced by reactions that break down the structure of NAD, providing a [[salvage pathway]] that recycles them back into their respective active form.

Some NAD is converted into the coenzyme [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate]] (NADP), whose chemistry largely parallels that of NAD, though its predominant role is as a coenzyme in [[anabolic]] metabolism.

In the name NAD{{+}}, the [[Subscript and superscript|superscripted]] plus sign indicates the positive [[formal charge]] on one of its nitrogen atoms.

==Physical and chemical properties==
{{Further|Redox}}
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide consists of two [[nucleoside]]s joined by [[pyrophosphate]]. The nucleosides each contain a [[ribose]] ring, one with [[adenine]] attached to the first carbon atom (the [[Nucleic acid nomenclature|1']] position) ([[adenosine diphosphate ribose]]) and the other with [[nicotinamide]] at this position.<ref>The nicotinamide group can be attached in two orientations to the anomeric ribose carbon atom. Because of these two possible structures, the NAD could exists as either of two [[diastereomer]]s. It is the β-nicotinamide diastereomer of NAD{{+}} that is found in nature.</ref><ref name=Pollak>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pollak N, Dölle C, Ziegler M |title= The power to reduce: pyridine nucleotides&nbsp;– small molecules with a multitude of functions |journal= Biochem.

The proton is released into solution, while the reductant RH{{sub|2}} is oxidized and NAD{{+}} reduced to NADH by transfer of the hydride to the nicotinamide ring.

:RH{{sub|2}} + NAD{{+}} → NADH + H{{+}} + R;

From the hydride electron pair, one electron is transferred to the positively charged nitrogen atom of the nicotinamide ring of NAD{{+}}, and the second hydrogen atom transferred to the C4 carbon atom opposite this N atom. The [[standard electrode potential#Non-standard condition|midpoint potential]] of the NAD{{+}}/NADH redox pair is −0.32&nbsp;[[volt]]s, which makes NADH a moderately strong ''reducing'' agent.<ref name=Unden>{{cite journal |vauthors=Unden G, Bongaerts J |title= Alternative respiratory pathways of ''Escherichia coli'': energetics and transcriptional regulation in response to electron acceptors |journal= Biochim.

Both NAD{{+}} and NADH strongly absorb [[ultraviolet]] light because of the adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD{{+}} is at a [[wavelength]] of 259&nbsp;[[nanometer]]s (nm), with an [[Molar absorptivity|extinction coefficient]] of 16,900&nbsp;[[Concentration#Molarity|M]]<sup>−1</sup>[[Centimetre|cm]]<sup>−1</sup>.

NAD{{+}} and NADH also differ in their [[fluorescence]].

==Biosynthesis==
NAD{{+}} is synthesized through two metabolic pathways. It is produced either in a [[de novo synthesis|''de novo'']] pathway from amino acids or in salvage pathways by recycling preformed components such as [[nicotinamide]] back to NAD{{+}}. Although most tissues synthesize NAD{{+}} by the salvage pathway in mammals, much more ''de novo'' synthesis occurs in the liver from tryptophan, and in the kidney and [[macrophage]]s from [[nicotinic acid]].<ref name="pmid32097708">{{cite journal | vauthors = McReynolds MR, Chellappa K, Baur JA | title = Age-related NAD + decline | journal = [[Experimental Gerontology]] | volume = 134 | pages = 110888 |date=2020 | doi = 10.1016/j.exger.2020.110888 | pmc =7442590 | pmid = 32097708}}</ref>

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide has several essential roles in [[metabolism]].

The main role of NAD{{+}} in metabolism is the transfer of electrons from one molecule to another. Reactions of this type are catalyzed by a large group of enzymes called [[oxidoreductase]]s. The correct names for these enzymes contain the names of both their substrates: for example [[NADH dehydrogenase|NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase]] catalyzes the oxidation of NADH by [[coenzyme Q]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme |title= Enzyme Nomenclature, Recommendations for enzyme names from the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |access-date= 6 December 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071205181246/http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/ |archive-date= 5 December 2007 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}</ref> However, these enzymes are also referred to as ''dehydrogenases'' or ''reductases'', with NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase commonly being called ''NADH dehydrogenase'' or sometimes ''coenzyme Q reductase''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/1.6.5.3 |title=NiceZyme View of ENZYME: EC 1.6.5.3 |access-date=2007-12-16 |publisher=Expasy}}</ref>

There are many different superfamilies of enzymes that bind NAD{{+}} / NADH.

[[File:NAD+ phys alt.svg|thumb|left|In this diagram, the hydride acceptor C4 carbon is shown at the top. When the nicotinamide ring lies in the plane of the page with the carboxy-amide to the right, as shown, the hydride donor lies either "above" or "below" the plane of the page. If "above" hydride transfer is class A, if "below" hydride transfer is class B.<ref name=bellamacina/>]]

When bound in the active site of an oxidoreductase, the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme is positioned so that it can accept a hydride from the other substrate. Depending on the enzyme, the hydride donor is positioned either "above" or "below" the plane of the planar C4 carbon, as defined in the figure. Class A oxidoreductases transfer the atom from above; class B enzymes transfer it from below. Since the C4 carbon that accepts the hydrogen is [[prochiral]], this can be exploited in [[enzyme kinetics]] to give information about the enzyme's mechanism. This is done by mixing an enzyme with a substrate that has [[deuterium]] atoms substituted for the hydrogens, so the enzyme will reduce NAD{{+}} by transferring deuterium rather than hydrogen. In this case, an enzyme can produce one of two [[stereoisomerism|stereoisomer]]s of NADH.<ref name=bellamacina>{{cite journal |author= Bellamacina CR |title= The nicotinamide dinucleotide binding motif: a comparison of nucleotide binding proteins |journal= FASEB J. |volume= 10 |issue= 11 |pages= 1257–69 |date= 1 September 1996 |pmid= 8836039|doi= 10.1096/fasebj.10.11.8836039 |s2cid= 24189316 }}</ref>

For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an [[ionic bond]] is formed between a basic amino acid side-chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP{{+}}. On the converse, in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP{{+}} from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and enzymes such as [[aldose reductase]], [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]], and [[methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase]] can use both coenzymes in some species.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Vickers TJ, Orsomando G, de la Garza RD, Scott DA, Kang SO, Hanson AD, Beverley SM |title= Biochemical and genetic analysis of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase in Leishmania metabolism and virulence |journal= J.

{{Further|Cellular respiration|Oxidative phosphorylation}}

The redox reactions catalyzed by oxidoreductases are vital in all parts of metabolism, but one particularly important area where these reactions occur is in the release of energy from nutrients. Here, reduced compounds such as [[glucose]] and [[fatty acid]]s are oxidized, thereby releasing energy. This energy is transferred to NAD{{+}} by reduction to NADH, as part of [[beta oxidation]], [[glycolysis]], and the [[citric acid cycle]]. In [[eukaryote]]s the electrons carried by the NADH that is produced in the [[cytoplasm]] are transferred into the [[mitochondrion]] (to reduce mitochondrial NAD{{+}}) by [[mitochondrial shuttle]]s, such as the [[malate-aspartate shuttle]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bakker BM, Overkamp KM, Kötter P, Luttik MA, Pronk JT |title= Stoichiometry and compartmentation of NADH metabolism in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' |journal= FEMS Microbiol.

Since both the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are used in these linked sets of reactions, the cell maintains significant concentrations of both NAD{{+}} and NADH, with the high NAD{{+}}/NADH ratio allowing this coenzyme to act as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent.<ref name=Nicholls>{{cite book|author=Nicholls DG|author2=Ferguson SJ |title=Bioenergetics 3 |edition=1st|publisher=Academic Press|year=2002 |isbn=978-0-12-518121-1}}</ref> In contrast, the main function of NADPH is as a reducing agent in [[anabolism]], with this coenzyme being involved in pathways such as [[fatty acid synthesis]] and [[photosynthesis]].

The coenzyme NAD{{+}} was first discovered by the British biochemists [[Arthur Harden]] and [[William John Young (biochemist)|William John Young]] in 1906.<ref>{{cite journal |first1= A |last1= Harden |last2= Young |first2=WJ |title= The alcoholic ferment of yeast-juice Part II.--The coferment of yeast-juice |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |series= Series B, Containing Papers of a Biological Character |volume= 78 |date= 24 October 1906 |pages= 369–375 |issue= 526 |jstor=80144 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1906.0070|doi-access= free }}</ref> They noticed that adding boiled and filtered [[yeast]] extract greatly accelerated [[alcoholic fermentation]] in unboiled yeast extracts. They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a ''coferment''. Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this heat-stable factor was identified as a [[nucleotide]] sugar phosphate by [[Hans von Euler-Chelpin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1929/euler-chelpin-lecture.pdf |title=Fermentation of sugars and fermentative enzymes |work=Nobel Lecture, 23 May 1930 |access-date=2007-09-30 |publisher=Nobel Foundation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927170330/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1929/euler-chelpin-lecture.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1936, the German scientist [[Otto Heinrich Warburg]] showed the function of the nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Warburg O, Christian W |title=Pyridin, der wasserstoffübertragende bestandteil von gärungsfermenten (pyridin-nucleotide) |language=de |trans-title=Pyridin, the hydrogen-transferring component of the fermentation enzymes (pyridine nucleotide) |journal=Biochemische Zeitschrift |volume=287 |year=1936 |page=291 |doi=10.1002/hlca.193601901199}}</ref>

The metabolism of NAD{{+}} remained an area of intense research into the 21st century, with interest heightened after the discovery of the NAD{{+}}-dependent protein deacetylases called [[sirtuin]]s in 2000, by Shin-ichiro Imai and coworkers in the laboratory of [[Leonard P.
