The '''Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II''' is an American family of single-seat, single-engine, all-weather [[Stealth aircraft|stealth]] [[multirole combat aircraft]] that is intended to perform both [[Air superiority fighter|air superiority]] and [[attack aircraft|strike]] missions. It is also able to provide [[electronic warfare]] and [[intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance]] capabilities. [[Lockheed Martin]] is the prime F-35 contractor, with principal partners [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[BAE Systems]]. The aircraft has three main variants: the [[CTOL|conventional takeoff and landing]] (CTOL) F-35A, the [[STOVL|short take-off and vertical-landing]] (STOVL) F-35B, and the [[carrier-based]] (CV/[[CATOBAR]]) F-35C.

The aircraft descends from the [[Lockheed Martin X-35]], which in 2001 beat the [[Boeing X-32]] to win the [[Joint Strike Fighter program|Joint Strike Fighter]] (JSF) program. Its development is principally funded by the United States, with additional funding from program partner countries from the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and close U.S. allies, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Italy, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and [[S-400 missile system#Turkey|formerly Turkey]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/f35/global-partnerships.html |title=F-35 Global Partnerships |website=Lockheed Martin |access-date=31 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902025203/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/f35/global-partnerships.html |archive-date=2 September 2012}}</ref><ref name="Dudley05Mar12">{{cite web |url=http://defense-update.com/20120305_program-partners-confirm-support-for-f-35-joint-strike-fighter.html |title=Program Partners Confirm Support for F-35 Joint Strike Fighter |first=Richard |last=Dudley |date=5 March 2012 |website=Defence Update}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite web |last=Pawlyk |first=Oriana |date=28 December 2020 |title=Key US Ally Declares Its F-35s Ready for Combat |url=https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/12/28/key-us-ally-declares-its-f-35s-ready-combat.html|access-date=29 December 2020 |website=Military.com |at=10th paragraph |language=en}}</ref> Several other countries have also ordered, or are considering ordering, the aircraft.

== Development ==
{{Main|Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II development}}

===Program origins===
The F-35 was the product of the [[Joint Strike Fighter]] (JSF) program, which was the merger of various combat aircraft programs from the 1980s and 1990s. One progenitor program was the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) Advanced Short Take-Off/Vertical Landing (ASTOVL) which ran from 1983 to 1994; ASTOVL aimed to develop a [[Harrier jump jet]] replacement for the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) and the U.K. [[Royal Navy]]. Under one of ASTOVL's classified programs, the Supersonic STOVL Fighter (SSF), [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[Skunk Works]] conducted research for a stealthy supersonic STOVL fighter intended for both U.S. Air Force (USAF) and USMC; a key technology explored was the shaft-driven lift fan (SDLF) system. Lockheed's concept was a single-engine [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] delta aircraft weighing about {{cvt|24000|lb|kg}} empty. ASTOVL was rechristened as the [[Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter]] (CALF) in 1993 and involved Lockheed, [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[Boeing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.codeonemagazine.com/images/C1_V09N3_SM_1271449318_9088.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200129013128/http://www.codeonemagazine.com/images/C1_V09N3_SM_1271449318_9088.pdf |archive-date=2020-01-29 |url-status=live |website=Code One Magazine |publisher=Lockheed |title=Common Lightweight Fighter |first=Stadler |last=Rich |date=October 1994}}</ref><ref name="pre-jast_hist">{{cite web |url=http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_prejast.htm |title=History (Pre-JAST) |work=Joint Strike Fighter |access-date=24 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206155846/http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_prejast.htm |archive-date=6 December 2019 }}</ref>

In 1993, the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program emerged following the cancellation of the USAF's Multi-Role Fighter (MRF) and U.S. Navy's (USN) Advanced Fighter-Attack (A/F-X) programs. MRF, a program for a relatively affordable [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] replacement, was scaled back and delayed due to post–Cold War defense posture easing F-16 fleet usage and thus extending its service life as well as increasing budget pressure from the [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F-22]] [[Advanced Tactical Fighter]] (ATF) program. The A/F-X, initially known as the Advanced-Attack (A-X), began in 1991 as the USN's follow-on to the Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) program for an [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6]] replacement; the ATA's resulting [[McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II|A-12 Avenger II]] had been canceled due to technical problems and cost overruns in 1991. In the same year, the termination of the Naval Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), a naval development of USAF's ATF program to replace the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]], resulted in additional fighter capability being added to A-X, which was then renamed A/F-X. Amid increased budget pressure, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]'s (DoD) Bottom-Up Review (BUR) in September 1993 announced MRF's and A/F-X's cancellations, with applicable experience brought to the emerging JAST program.<ref name="pre-jast_hist"/> JAST was not meant to develop a new aircraft, but rather to develop requirements, mature technologies, and demonstrate concepts for advanced strike warfare.<ref name="jast_hist">{{cite web |url=http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_jast.htm |title=History (JAST) |work=Joint Strike Fighter |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715052740/http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_jast.htm |archive-date=15 July 2019 |access-date=24 January 2020 }}</ref>

As JAST progressed, the need for concept demonstrator aircraft by 1996 emerged, which would coincide with the full-scale flight demonstrator phase of ASTOVL/CALF. Because the ASTOVL/CALF concept appeared to align with the JAST charter, the two programs were eventually merged in 1994 under the JAST name, with the program now serving the USAF, USMC, and USN.<ref name="jast_hist"/> JAST was subsequently renamed to Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) in 1995, with STOVL submissions by McDonnell Douglas, [[Northrop Grumman]], [[Lockheed Martin]],{{refn|Lockheed acquired General Dynamics fighter division at Fort Worth in 1993 and merged with Martin Marietta in 1995 to form Lockheed Martin.|group=N}} and Boeing. The JSF was expected to eventually replace large numbers of multi-role and strike fighters in the inventories of the US and its allies, including the Harrier, F-16, [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]], [[Fairchild A-10|A-10]], and [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|F-117]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Barrie |first1=Douglas |last2=Norris |first2=Guy |last3=Warwick |first3=Graham |name-list-style=amp |date=4 April 1995 |title=Short take-off, low funding |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1995/1995%20-%200833.html |work=FlightGlobal |access-date=24 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717172813/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1995/1995%20-%200833.html |archive-date=17 July 2015 }}</ref>

International participation is a key aspect of the JSF program, starting with United Kingdom participation in the ASTOVL program. Many international partners requiring modernization of their air forces were interested in the JSF. The United Kingdom joined JAST/JSF as a founding member in 1995 and thus became the only Tier 1 partner of the JSF program;<ref name="T1partner">{{cite web |url=http://www.jsf.org.uk/ |title=The JSF UK Industry Team |work=Martin Baker Aircraft Company Limited |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427142906/http://www.jsf.org.uk/ |archive-date=27 April 2006}}</ref> Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Canada, Australia, and Turkey joined the program during the Concept Demonstration Phase (CDP), with Italy and the Netherlands being Tier 2 partners and the rest Tier 3. Consequently, the aircraft was developed in cooperation with international partners and available for export.<ref name="UKJAST">{{cite news |title=US, UK sign JAST agreement |date=25 November 1995 |work=Aerospace Daily |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=451}}</ref>

===JSF competition===
{{Main|Joint Strike Fighter program|Lockheed Martin X-35}}

Boeing and Lockheed Martin were selected in early 1997 for CDP, with their concept demonstrator aircraft designated [[Boeing X-32|X-32]] and [[Lockheed Martin X-35|X-35]] respectively; the McDonnell Douglas team was eliminated and Northrop Grumman and [[British Aerospace]] joined the Lockheed Martin team. Each firm would produce two prototype air vehicles to demonstrate conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL), carrier takeoff and landing (CV), and STOVL.{{refn|As these were concept demonstrator aircraft for risk reduction, they did not need to have the internal structure or most subsystems of the final aircraft as a weapon system.|group=N}} Lockheed Martin's design would make use of the work on the SDLF system conducted under the ASTOVL/CALF program. The key aspect of the X-35 that enabled STOVL operation, the SDLF system consists of the lift fan in the forward center fuselage that could be activated by engaging a clutch that connects the driveshaft to the turbines and thus augmenting the thrust from the engine's swivel nozzle. Research from prior aircraft incorporating similar systems, such as the [[Convair Model 200]],{{refn|The F-35 swivel nozzle design was pioneered by the Convair Model 200.<ref>{{cite web |last=Renshaw |first=Kevin |url=https://www.codeonemagazine.com/f35_article.html?item_id=137 |title=F-35B Lightning II Three-Bearing Swivel Nozzle |work=Code One Magazine |date=12 August 2014}}</ref>|group=N}} [[Rockwell XFV-12]], and [[Yakovlev Yak-141]], were also taken into consideration.<ref name="GovExec">{{cite web |url=http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0102/012202db.htm |title=The engine that could |first=George C. |last=Wilson |date=22 January 2002 |website=[[Government Executive]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019160442/http://www.govexec.com/defense/defense-beat/2002/01/the-engine-that-could/10890/ |archive-date=19 October 2013}}</ref><ref name="LiftFanPatent1">{{cite web |url=http://www.patentgenius.com/patent/5209428.html |title=Propulsion system for a vertical and short takeoff and landing aircraft, United States Patent 5209428 |date=7 May 1990 |website=PatentGenius.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225075708/http://www.patentgenius.com/patent/5209428.html |archive-date=25 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Gunston |first=Bill |author-link=Bill Gunston |date=1997 |title=Yakovlev Aircraft since 1924 |url=https://archive.org/details/yakovlevaircraft00guns/page/n16 |url-access=limited |location=London |publisher=Putnam Aeronautical Books |page=16 |isbn=1-55750-978-6}}</ref> By contrast, Boeing's X-32 employed direct lift system that the augmented turbofan would be reconfigured to when engaging in STOVL operation.

[[File:X-35B Edwards.jpg|thumb|X-35B flying over Edwards Air Force Base]]
Lockheed Martin's commonality strategy was to replace the STOVL variant's SDLF with a fuel tank and the aft swivel nozzle with a two-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzle for the CTOL variant.{{refn|The thrust vectoring nozzle would eventually be replaced by an axisymmetric low-observable nozzle to reduce weight.|group=N}} This would enable identical aerodynamic configuration for the STOVL and CTOL variants, while the CV variant would have an enlarged wing to reduce landing speed for carrier recovery.<ref name="jast_to_ioc">{{cite journal |last1=Sheridan |first1=Arthur E. |last2=Burnes |first2=Robert |date=13 August 2019 |title=F-35 Program History: From JAST to IOC |url=https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/5.9781624105678.0001.0076 |journal=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) |page=50 |doi=10.2514/5.9781624105678.0001.0076 |isbn=978-1-62410-566-1}}</ref> Due to aerodynamic characteristics and carrier recovery requirements from the JAST merger, the design configuration settled on a conventional tail compared to the canard delta design from the ASTOVL/CALF; notably, the conventional tail configuration offers much lower risk for carrier recovery compared to the ASTOVL/CALF canard configuration, which was designed without carrier compatibility in mind. This enabled greater commonality between all three variants, as the commonality goal was important at this design stage.<ref name="jast_to_ioc"/> Lockheed Martin's prototypes would consist of the X-35A for demonstrating CTOL before converting it to the X-35B for STOVL demonstration and the larger-winged X-35C for CV compatibility demonstration.<ref name="JPP">{{cite journal |last=Bevilaqua |first=Paul M. |url=https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/1.15228 |title=Joint Strike Fighter Dual-Cycle Propulsion System |journal=Journal of Propulsion and Power |date=September 2005 |doi=10.2514/1.15228 |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=778–783}}</ref>

===Design and production===

As the JSF program moved into the System Development and Demonstration phase, the X-35 demonstrator design was modified to create the F-35 combat aircraft. The forward fuselage was lengthened by {{convert|5|in|cm}} to make room for mission avionics, while the horizontal stabilizers were moved {{convert|2|in|cm}} aft to retain balance and control. The diverterless supersonic inlet changed from a four-sided to a three-sided cowl shape and was moved {{convert|30|in|cm}} aft. The fuselage section was fuller, the top surface raised by {{convert|1|in|cm}} along the centerline to accommodate weapons bays. Following the designation of the X-35 prototypes, the three variants were designated F-35A (CTOL), F-35B (STOVL), and F-35C (CV), all with a design service life of 8,000 hours.

Adding the systems of a fighter aircraft added weight. The F-35B gained the most, largely due to a 2003 decision to enlarge the weapons bays for commonality between variants; the total weight growth was reportedly up to {{convert|2200|lb}}, over 8%, causing all STOVL key performance parameter (KPP) thresholds to be missed.<ref name="Keijsper 2007, p. 119">Keijsper 2007, p. 119</ref> In December 2003, the STOVL Weight Attack Team (SWAT) was formed to reduce the weight increase; changes included thinned airframe members, smaller weapons bays and vertical stabilizers, less thrust fed to the roll-post outlets, and redesigning the wing-mate joint, electrical elements, and the airframe immediately aft of the cockpit.

The aircraft's software was developed as six releases, or Blocks, for SDD. The first two Blocks, 1A and 1B, readied the F-35 for initial pilot training and multi-level security. Block 2A improved the training capabilities, while 2B was the first combat-ready release planned for the USMC's [[Initial Operating Capability]] (IOC). Block 3i retains the capabilities of 2B while having new hardware and was planned for the USAF's IOC. The final release for SDD, Block 3F, would have full flight envelope and all baseline combat capabilities.

===Stealth and signatures ===
[[File:33rd FTS, F-35 training 131212-F-TJ158-008.jpg|thumb|Note the sawtooth design on the landing gear door and access panels]]

Stealth is a key aspect of the F-35's design, and [[radar cross-section]] (RCS) is minimized through careful shaping of the airframe and the use of [[radar-absorbent material]]s (RAM); visible measures to reduce RCS include alignment of edges, serration of skin panels, and the masking of the engine face and turbine. Additionally, the F-35's diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) uses a compression bump and forward-swept cowl rather than a [[splitter plate (aeronautics)|splitter gap]] or bleed system to divert the [[boundary layer]] away from the inlet duct, eliminating the diverter cavity and further reducing radar signature.<ref name="dsi"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://aviationintel.com/2012/10/22/fast-history-lockheeds-diverterless-supersonic-inlet-testbed-f-16/ |title=Fast History: Lockheed's Diverterless Supersonic Inlet Testbed F-16 |date=22 October 2012 |website=Aviation Intel |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907000042/http://aviationintel.com/2012/10/22/fast-history-lockheeds-diverterless-supersonic-inlet-testbed-f-16/ |archive-date=7 September 2013}}</ref> The RCS of the F-35 has been characterized as lower than a metal golf ball at certain frequencies and angles; in some conditions, the F-35 compares favorably to the F-22 in stealth.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Tirpak |first=John A. |url=https://www.airforcemag.com/article/The-F-35-on-Final-Approach/ |title=The F-35 on Final Approach |magazine=Air Force |date=26 November 2014 |access-date=1 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://breakingdefense.com/2015/03/threat-data-biggest-worry-for-f-35as-ioc-but-it-will-be-on-time/ |title=Threat Data Biggest Worry For F-35A's IOC; But It 'Will Be On Time' |first=Colin |last=Clark |date=11 March 2015 |work=Breaking Defense |access-date=31 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Colin |url=http://breakingdefense.com/2014/06/gen-mike-hostage-on-the-f-35-no-growlers-needed-when-war-starts/3/ |title=Gen.

The F-35 is expected to receive propulsion upgrades over its lifecycle to adapt to emerging threats and enable additional capabilities. In 2016, the Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP) was launched to develop and test adaptive cycle engines, with one major potential application being the re-engining of the F-35; in 2018, both GE and P&W were awarded contracts to develop {{cvt|45000|lbf|kN}} thrust class demonstrators, with the designations [[XA100]] and [[XA101]] respectively.<ref name="fg20180709">{{cite web |last=Trimble |first=Steven |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/fixed-wing/usaf-starts-work-on-defining-adaptive-engine-for-future-fighter/128748.article |title=USAF starts work on defining adaptive engine for future fighter |work=FlightGlobal |date=9 July 2018}}</ref> In addition to potential re-engining, P&W also plans to improve the baseline F135; in 2017, P&W announced the F135 Growth Option 1.0 and 2.0; Growth Option 1.0 was a drop-in power module upgrade that offered 6–10% thrust improvement and 5–6% fuel burn reduction, while Growth Option 2.0 would be the adaptive cycle XA101.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pratt--whitney-validates-growth-option-for-f135-engine-300466212.html |title=Pratt & Whitney Validates Growth Option for F135 Engine |date=31 May 2017 |agency=PR Newswire |access-date=25 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Kjelgaard |first=Chris |url=https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2017-06-15/pw-outlines-three-step-f135-development-pathway |title=P&W Outlines Three-step F135 Development Pathway |work=Aviation International News |date=15 June 2017 |access-date=11 January 2020}}</ref> In 2020, P&W shifted its F135 upgrade plan from the Growth Options to a series of Engine Enhancement Packages along with some additional capabilities, while the XA101 became a separate clean-sheet design.

===Maintenance and logistics ===
The F-35 is designed to require less maintenance than prior stealth aircraft. Some 95% of all field-replaceable parts are "one deep"—that is, nothing else need be removed to reach the desired part; for instance, the ejection seat can be replaced without removing the canopy. The F-35 has a fibermat radar-absorbent material (RAM) baked into the skin, which is more durable, easier to work with, and faster to cure than older RAM coatings; similar coatings are being considered for application on older stealth aircraft such as the F-22.<ref name="Countermeasures">{{cite web |url=https://aviationweek.com/new-classified-stealth-concept-could-affect-jsf-maintenance-costs |title=New, Classified Stealth Concept Could Affect JSF Maintenance Costs |first=Amy |last=Butler |date=17 May 2010 |website=Aviation Week |url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref name="raptorroadmap2019">{{cite web |last=Zazulia |first=Nick |url=https://www.aviationtoday.com/2018/10/11/rejuvenating-raptor-roadmap-f-22-modernization/ |title=Rejuvenating the Raptor: Roadmap for F-22 Modernization |work=Avionics Today |date=11 October 2018 |access-date=15 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216035441/https://www.aviationtoday.com/2018/10/11/rejuvenating-raptor-roadmap-f-22-modernization/ |archive-date=16 February 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-air-force-praises-early-performance-of-lockheed-martin-f-35-378578/ |title=US Air Force praises early performance of Lockheed Martin F-35 |first=Dave |last=Majumdar |date=6 November 2012 |website=FlightGlobal}}</ref> Skin corrosion on the F-22 led the F-35 using a less [[galvanic corrosion]]-inducing skin gap filler, fewer gaps in the airframe skin needing filler, and better drainage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11171r.pdf |title=Defense Management: DOD Needs to Monitor and Assess Corrective Actions Resulting from Its Corrosion Study of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter |first=Jack E. |last=Edwards |date=16 December 2010 |website=[[Government Accountability Office]] |access-date=17 December 2010 |archive-date=5 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200805173946/https://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11171r.pdf }}</ref> The flight control system uses [[electro-hydrostatic actuator]]s rather than traditional hydraulic systems; these controls can be powered by lithium-ion batteries in case of emergency.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/farnborough-lockheed-encouraged-by-pace-of-f-35-tes-343782/ |title=Farnborough: Lockheed encouraged by pace of F-35 testing |first=Stephen |last=Trimble |date=12 July 2010 |website=Flight International}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aviationtoday.com/2013/07/23/li-ion-battery-in-production-for-f-35s/ |title=Li-Ion Battery in Production for F-35s |work=Avionics International |date=23 July 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200125091218/https://www.aviationtoday.com/2013/07/23/li-ion-battery-in-production-for-f-35s/ |archive-date=25 January 2020  |access-date=25 January 2020}}</ref> Commonality between variants led to the USMC's first aircraft maintenance Field Training Detachment, which applied USAF lessons to their F-35 operations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/110740/f-35-maintenance-training-spawns-usmcs-first-air-ftd/ |title=F-35 maintenance training spawns USMC's first air FTD |first=Dan |last=Hawkins |date=27 July 2012 |work=U.S. Air Force}}</ref>

The first F-35A, AA-1, conducted its engine run in September 2006 and first flew on 15 December 2006.<ref name="jsf_engine_run">{{cite web |url=https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2006-09-20-Mighty-F-35-Lightning-II-Engine-Roars-to-Life |title=Mighty F-35 Lightning II Engine Roars to Life |date=20 September 2006 |website=Lockheed Martin}}</ref> Unlike all subsequent aircraft, AA-1 did not have the weight optimization from SWAT; consequently, it mainly tested subsystems common to subsequent aircraft, such as the propulsion, electrical system, and cockpit displays. This aircraft was retired from flight testing in December 2009 and was used for live-fire testing at [[NAS China Lake]].<ref>{{cite report |title=Department of Defense Authorization for Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2011}}</ref>

In addition to deploying F-35Bs on amphibious assault ships, the USMC plans to disperse the aircraft among austere forward-deployed bases with shelter and concealment to enhance survivability while remaining close to a battlespace. Known as distributed STOVL operations (DSO), F-35Bs would operate from temporary bases in allied territory within hostile missile engagement zones and displace inside the enemy's 24- to 48-hour targeting cycle; this strategy allows F-35Bs to rapidly respond to operational needs, with mobile forward arming and refueling points (M-FARPs) accommodating [[Lockheed Martin KC-130|KC-130]] and [[MV-22 Osprey]] aircraft to rearm and refuel the jets, as well as littoral areas for sea links of mobile distribution sites. For higher echelons of maintenance, F-35Bs would return from M-FARPs to rear-area friendly bases or ships. Helicopter-portable metal planking is needed to protect unprepared roads from the F-35B's exhaust; the USMC are studying lighter heat-resistant options.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aviationweek.com/defense/marines-propose-rapidly-mobile-f-35-operations |title=Marines Propose Rapidly Mobile F-35 Operations |date=16 December 2014 |website=Aviation Week |url-access=subscription}}</ref> These operations have become part of the larger USMC Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) concept.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.usni.org/2019/04/23/marines-folding-f-35b-into-new-pacific-island-hopping-concept |title=Marines Folding F-35B into New Pacific Island-Hopping Concept |work=USNI News |date=23 April 2019}}</ref>

The F-35 was designed with three initial variants – the F-35A, a CTOL land-based version; the F-35B, a STOVL version capable of use either on land or on aircraft carriers; and the F-35C, a CATOBAR carrier-based version. Since then, there has been work on the design of nationally specific versions for Israel and Canada.

===F-35A===
The F-35A is the [[conventional take-off and landing]] (CTOL) variant intended for the USAF and other air forces. It is the smallest, lightest version and capable of 9 [[g-force|g]], the highest of all variants.

Although the F-35A currently conducts [[aerial refueling]] via boom and receptacle method, the aircraft can be modified for [[Aerial refueling#Probe-and-drogue|probe-and-drogue]] refueling if needed by the customer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/in-focus-tokyo-casts-wary-eye-on-chinese-airpower-developments-375007/ |title=In Focus: Tokyo casts wary eye on Chinese airpower developments |first=Greg |last=Waldron |date=2 August 2012 |website=Flight International}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dodbuzz.com/2012/06/19/lockheeds-comprehensive-qa-on-the-f-35/ |title=Lockheed's comprehensive Q&A on the F-35 |first=Philip |last=Ewing |date=19 June 2012 |website=DoD Buzz |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818131239/http://www.dodbuzz.com/2012/06/19/lockheeds-comprehensive-qa-on-the-f-35/ |archive-date=18 August 2012}}</ref><!-- Add flight testing info to Testing section above. --> A [[drag chute]] pod can be installed on the F-35A, with the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] being the first operator to adopt it.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=http://www.codeonemagazine.com/index.html |title=F-35 Lightning Drag Chute |date=13 August 2014 |website=Code One Magazine |access-date=20 January 2020}}</ref>

===F-35B===

[[File:Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II cutaway with liftfan.jpg|thumb|F-35B cutaway with lift fan]]

The F-35B is the [[short take-off and vertical landing aircraft|short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL)]] variant of the aircraft. Similar in size to the A variant, the B sacrifices about a third of the A variant's fuel volume to accommodate the SDLF.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The STOVL Joint Strike Fighter in Support of the 21st Century Marine Corps |first=Ben D. |last=Hancock |year=1997 |website=Defense Technical Information Center |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA493330}}</ref><ref name="From Archive.org-2117330">{{cite web |url=http://www.usace-isc.org/presentation/Geotech%20and%20Materials%20II/Constructability_of_a_High_Temperature_Concrete_Pad_Bly_Peter.pdf |title=Constructability of a High Temperature Concrete Pad |work=Geotechnical & Structures Laboratory, US Army Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC) |first=Peter |last=Bly |date=14 June 2011 |access-date=15 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425045722/http://www.usace-isc.org/presentation/Geotech%20and%20Materials%20II/Constructability_of_a_High_Temperature_Concrete_Pad_Bly_Peter.pdf |archive-date=25 April 2012}}</ref> This variant is limited to 7&nbsp;g.

===F-35C===
The F-35C is a [[carrier-based aircraft|carrier-based]] variant designed for [[CATOBAR|catapult-assisted take-off but arrested recovery]] operations from aircraft carriers. Compared to the F-35A, the F-35C features larger wings with [[Folding wing|foldable wingtip sections]], larger control surfaces for improved low-speed control, stronger landing gear for the stresses of [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]] arrested landings, a twin-wheel nose gear, and a stronger [[tailhook]] for use with carrier [[arrestor cable]]s.<ref name="newhook"/> The larger wing area allows for decreased landing speed while increasing both range and payload.

* [[Republic of China Air Force]] – Taiwan has requested to buy the F-35 from the US. However this has been rejected by the US in fear of a critical response from China. In March 2009 Taiwan again was looking to buy U.S. fifth-generation fighter jets featuring stealth and vertical takeoff capabilities.{{cn|date=April 2023}} However, in September 2011, during a visit to the US, the Deputy Minister of National Defense of Taiwan confirmed that while the country was busy upgrading its current F-16s it was still also looking to procure a next-generation aircraft such as the F-35. This received the usual critical response from China.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan plans to request F-35s from US|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/09/20/2003513701|access-date=16 January 2012|newspaper=Taipei Times|date=20 September 2011}}</ref> Taiwan renewed its push for an F-35 purchase under the [[Presidency of Donald Trump]] in early 2017, again causing criticism from China.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shim|first1=Elizabeth|title=Taiwan's plan to buy F-35 fighter jets riles China|url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/04/28/Taiwans-plan-to-buy-F-35-fighter-jets-riles-China/8691493405302/|website=United Press International|access-date=17 October 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171017100017/https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/04/28/Taiwans-plan-to-buy-F-35-fighter-jets-riles-China/8691493405302/|archive-date=17 October 2017|date=28 April 2017}}</ref> In March 2018, Taiwan once again reiterated its interest in the F-35 in light of an anticipated round of arms procurement from the United States.

In November 2018, it was reported that Taiwanese military leadership had abandoned the procurement of the F-35 in favor of a larger number of [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#F-16V Viper|F-16V Viper]] aircraft. The decision was reportedly motivated by concerns about industry independence, as well as cost and previously raised espionage concerns.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zhezheng |first1=Hong |title=放棄F-35 我擬對美採購66架F-16V新戰機 |url=https://udn.com/news/story/10930/3506279?from=udn-catelistnews_ch2 |access-date=29 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129084221/https://udn.com/news/story/10930/3506279?from=udn-catelistnews_ch2 |archive-date=29 November 2018 |language=zh |date=28 November 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

On 29 September 2020, a USMC F-35B crashed in [[Imperial County]], California, after colliding with a Marine Corps KC-130 during [[air-to-air refuelling]].

On 12 March 2021, during a close air support weapons training night-time flight near Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, [[Arizona]], a round fired from the belly-mounted gunpod on a F-35B, a 25mm GAU/A gatling gun, detonated shortly after leaving the barrel of the gun. This specific round fired was a PGU-32/B SAPHEI-T (semi armor piercing high explosive incendiary-tracer), which is designed to detonate after the round has penetrated the target's armor, beginning a [[fuze]] delayed explosion and then spread the incendiary material. These rounds are also equipped with graze detection, meaning even with a slight grazing blow to a target they will explode and spread the incendiary substance. The mishap was classified as a Class C, meaning the damage incurred a cost of between $60,000-$600,000 to repair, and/or a nonfatal injury forcing lost time from work for the remainder of the working day that the injury occurred. The aircraft itself was grounded for maintenance for over three months, but the pilot was uninjured. The shrapnel from the round penetrated several parts of the aircraft, requiring their replacement.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Trevithick |first=Joseph |date=2021-03-24 |title=A Marine F-35B Fighter Jet Accidentally Shot Itself With Its Own Gun Pod (Updated) |url=https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/39920/a-marine-f-35b-fighter-jet-accidentally-shot-itself-with-its-own-gun-pod |access-date=2022-06-08 |website=The Drive |language=en}}</ref>

On 19 October 2022, an F-35A crashed at the North end of the runway at [[Hill Air Force Base]] in Utah. The pilot safely ejected and was unharmed. The cause of the crash is due to errors in the air data system from the wake turbulence of a preceding aircraft, which resulted in several rapid transitions between the primary and backup flight conditions data sources; these rapid transitions then caused the accumulation of reset values, resulting in the flight control laws operating on inaccurate flight conditions data and the departure from controlled flight.<ref>{{cite report |url= https://www.afjag.af.mil/Portals/77/AIB-Reports/2022/19%20Oct%202023%20ACC%20F-35A%20388th%20FW%20Hill%20AFB%20AIB%20Report.pdf |title=UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION BOARD REPORT, F-35 T/N 15-5197 |publisher=U.S. Air Force |date=7 February 2023}}</ref>
