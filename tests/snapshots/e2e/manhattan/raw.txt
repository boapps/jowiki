Geologically, a predominant feature of the [[Structure of Earth|substrata]] of Manhattan is that the underlying bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near Midtown Manhattan, dips down lower between [[29th Street (Manhattan)|29th Street]] and [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]], then rises toward the surface again in Lower Manhattan. It has been widely believed that the depth to bedrock was the primary reason for the clustering of skyscrapers in the Midtown and [[Financial District (Manhattan)|Financial District]] areas, and their absence over the intervening territory between these two areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/jhoodwrightpark/highlights/12369 |title=Manhattan Schist in New York City Parks&nbsp;– J.

According to the [[United States Geological Survey]], an updated analysis of [[seismic hazard]] in July 2014 revealed a "slightly lower hazard for tall buildings" in Manhattan than previously assessed. Scientists estimated this lessened risk based upon a lower likelihood than previously thought of slow shaking near New York City, which would be more likely to cause damage to taller structures from an earthquake in the vicinity of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/new-insight-on-the-nations-earthquake-hazards/|title=New Insight on the Nation's Earthquake Hazards|author1=Jessica Robertson|author2=Mark Petersen|name-list-style=amp|publisher=United States Geological Survey|date=July 17, 2014|access-date=August 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811003539/http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/new-insight-on-the-nations-earthquake-hazards/|archive-date=August 11, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In Manhattan, ''uptown'' means north (more precisely north-northeast, which is the direction the island and its [[street grid]] system are oriented) and ''downtown'' means south (south-southwest).<ref>Petzold, Charles.

Manhattan has two central business districts, the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] at the southern tip of the island, and [[Midtown Manhattan]].

[[Fifth Avenue]] roughly bisects Manhattan Island and acts as the demarcation line for east/west designations (e.g., East 27th Street, West 42nd Street); street addresses start at Fifth Avenue and increase heading away from Fifth Avenue, at a rate of 100 per block on most streets.<ref name="NYCBasics"/> South of [[Waverly Place]], Fifth Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east/west demarcation line. Although the grid does start with 1st Street, just north of [[Houston Street]] (the southernmost street divided in west and east portions), the grid does not fully take hold until north of [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], where nearly all east–west streets are numerically identified, which increase from south to north to 220th Street, the highest numbered street on the island. Streets in Midtown are usually one-way, with the few exceptions generally being the busiest cross-town thoroughfares (14th, 23rd, 34th, and 42nd Streets, for example), which are bidirectional across the width of Manhattan Island. Typically odd-numbered streets run west, while even-numbered streets run east.<ref name=Stuff/>

Manhattan has been the scene of many important global and American cultural movements. The [[Harlem Renaissance]] in the 1920s established the African-American literary canon in the United States and introduced writers [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Zora Neale Hurston]]. Manhattan's visual art scene in the 1950s and 1960s was a center of the [[pop art]] movement, which gave birth to such giants as [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. The downtown pop art movement of the late 1970s included artist [[Andy Warhol]] and clubs like [[Serendipity 3]] and [[Studio 54]], where he socialized.

The office of [[Borough President]] was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority. Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the [[New York City Board of Estimate]], which was responsible for creating and approving the city's budget and proposals for land use. In 1989, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional because Brooklyn, the most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island, the least populous borough, a violation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment's]] [[Equal Protection Clause]] pursuant to the high court's 1964 "one man, one vote" decision.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0489_0688_ZS.html Cornell Law School Supreme Court Collection: Board of Estimate of City of New York v.

[[File:Manhattanhenge 2016-07-12-FRD.png|thumb|Tourists observing [[Manhattanhenge]] on July 12, 2016]]
The [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]] called for twelve numbered avenues running north and south roughly parallel to the shore of the [[Hudson River]], each {{convert|100|ft|m|-1}} wide, with [[First Avenue (Manhattan)|First Avenue]] on the east side and [[Twelfth Avenue (Manhattan)|Twelfth Avenue]] on the west side. There are several intermittent avenues east of First Avenue, including four additional lettered avenues running from [[Avenue A (Manhattan)|Avenue A]] eastward to [[Avenue D (Manhattan)|Avenue D]] in an area now known as [[Alphabet City, Manhattan|Alphabet City]] in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. The numbered streets in Manhattan run east–west, and are generally {{convert|60|ft|m|0}} wide, with about {{convert|200|ft|m|0}} between each pair of streets. With each combined street and block adding up to about {{convert|260|ft|m}}, there are almost exactly 20&nbsp;blocks per mile. The typical block in Manhattan is {{convert|250|by|600|ft|m}}. The [[Manhattan address algorithm|address algorithm of Manhattan]] refers to the formulas used to estimate the closest east–west cross street for building numbers on north–south avenues.

According to the original Commissioner's Plan, there were [[155th Street (Manhattan)|155]] numbered crosstown streets,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/23/realestate/23scap.html |title=Are Manhattan's Right Angles Wrong, by Christopher Gray |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 23, 2005 |access-date=May 11, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502035251/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/23/realestate/23scap.html |archive-date=May 2, 2013 |url-status=live |last1=Gray |first1=Christopher }}</ref> but later the grid was extended up to the northernmost corner of Manhattan, where the last numbered street is [[220th Street (Manhattan)|220th Street]]. Moreover, the numbering system continues even in [[the Bronx]], north of Manhattan, despite the fact that the grid plan is not as regular in that borough, whose last numbered street is 263rd Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gis.nyc.gov/doitt/nycitymap/ |title=New York City Map |publisher=NYC.gov |access-date=May 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731043934/http://gis.nyc.gov/doitt/nycitymap/ |archive-date=July 31, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Fifteen crosstown streets were designated as {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide, including [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th]], [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd]], [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th]] and [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th]] Streets,<ref>[http://www.library.cornell.edu/Reps/DOCS/nyc1811.htm Remarks of the Commissioners for laying out streets and roads in the City of New York, under the Act of April 3, 1807] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610165318/http://www.library.cornell.edu/Reps/DOCS/nyc1811.htm |date=June 10, 2007 }}, [[Cornell University]].

[[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] is the most notable of many exceptions to the grid, starting at [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] in Lower Manhattan and continuing north into the Bronx at Manhattan's northern tip. In much of Midtown Manhattan, Broadway runs at a diagonal to the grid, creating major named intersections at [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] ([[Park Avenue|Park Avenue South/Fourth Avenue]] and 14th Street), [[Madison Square]] ([[Fifth Avenue]] and 23rd Street), [[Herald Square]] ([[Sixth Avenue]] and 34th Street), [[Times Square]] ([[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] and 42nd Street), and [[Columbus Circle]] ([[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]]/[[Central Park West]] and 59th Street).

"Crosstown traffic" refers primarily to vehicular traffic between Manhattan's [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]] and [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]]. The trip is notoriously frustrating for drivers because of heavy [[traffic congestion|congestion]] on narrow local streets laid out by the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, absence of express roads other than the [[Trans-Manhattan Expressway]] at the far north end of Manhattan Island; and restricted to very limited crosstown automobile travel within [[Central Park]]. Proposals in the mid-1900s to build express roads through the city's densest neighborhoods, namely the [[Mid-Manhattan Expressway]] and [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]], did not go forward. Unlike the rest of the United States, New York State prohibits right or left turns on red in cities with a population greater than one million, to reduce traffic collisions and increase pedestrian safety. In New York City, therefore, all turns at red lights are illegal unless a sign permitting such maneuvers is present, significantly shaping traffic patterns in Manhattan.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.safeny.ny.gov/roadrule.htm | title=Rules of the Road}}</ref>

Another consequence of the strict grid plan of most of Manhattan, and the grid's skew of approximately 28.9&nbsp;degrees, is a phenomenon sometimes referred to as [[Manhattanhenge]] (by analogy with [[Stonehenge]]).<ref name=Manhattanhenge>{{cite news | last=Silverman | first=Justin Rocket | title=Sunny delight in city sight | newspaper=[[Newsday]] | date=May 27, 2006 | url=http://www.newsday.com/news/sunny-delight-in-city-sight-1.502140 | quote='Manhattanhenge' occurs Sunday, a day when a happy coincidence of urban planning and astrophysics results in the setting sun lining up exactly with every east-west street in the borough north of 14th Street.

Being primarily an island, Manhattan is linked to New York City's outer boroughs by numerous bridges, of various sizes. Manhattan has fixed [[highway]] connections with [[New Jersey]] to its west by way of the [[George Washington Bridge]], the [[Holland Tunnel]], and the [[Lincoln Tunnel]], and to three of the four other New York City boroughs—[[the Bronx]] to the northeast, and [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]] (both on [[Long Island]]) to the east and south. Its only direct connection with the fifth New York City borough, [[Staten Island]], is the [[Staten Island Ferry]] across [[New York Harbor]], which is free of charge. The ferry terminal is located near [[Battery Park (New York)|Battery Park]] at Manhattan's southern tip. It is also possible to travel on land to Staten Island by way of Brooklyn, via the [[Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge]].
