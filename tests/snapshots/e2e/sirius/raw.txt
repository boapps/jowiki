'''Sirius''' is the [[list of brightest stars|brightest star]] in the [[night sky]]. Its name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|{{math|Σείριος}}}}, or {{transl|grc|Seirios}}, meaning {{lit}} 'glowing' or 'scorching'. The star is [[Bayer designation|designated]] '''{{math|α}}&nbsp;Canis Majoris''', [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] to '''Alpha Canis Majoris''', and abbreviated '''{{math|α}}&nbsp;CMa''' or '''Alpha&nbsp;CMa'''. With a visual [[apparent magnitude]] of −1.46, Sirius is almost twice as bright as [[Canopus]], the next brightest star. Sirius is a [[binary star]] consisting of a [[main-sequence]] [[star]] of [[spectral type]] [[A-type main-sequence star|A0 or A1]], termed Sirius&nbsp;A, and a faint [[white dwarf]] companion of spectral type&nbsp;DA2, termed Sirius&nbsp;B. The distance between the two varies between 8.2 and 31.5&nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s as they orbit every 50&nbsp;years.<ref name="Schaaf2008"/>

Sirius appears bright because of its intrinsic [[luminosity]] and its proximity to the [[Solar System]]. At a distance of {{convert|2.64|pc|ly|lk=on}}, the Sirius system is one of Earth's [[List of nearest stars|nearest neighbours]]. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System; it is expected to increase in brightness slightly over the next 60,000&nbsp;years to reach a peak magnitude of −1.68.
Coincidentally, at about the same time, Sirius will take its turn as the southern Pole Star, around the year 66270. In that year, Sirius will come to within 1.6 degrees of the south celestial pole. This is due to precession and proper motion of Sirius itself which moves slowly in the SSW direction. So it will be visible from the southern hemisphere only.
<ref>{{cite book |title=Sirius is a future southern Pole Star |date=2023-02-11|url=https://earthsky.org/tonight/sirius-future-south-pole-star/}}</ref> 
After that time, its distance will begin to increase, and it will become fainter, but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth's night sky for approximately the next 210,000&nbsp;years, at which point [[Vega]], another [[A-type main-sequence star|A-type star]] that is intrinsically more luminous than Sirius, becomes the brightest star.<ref name="tomkin98">{{cite journal |last=Tomkin |first=Jocelyn |date=April 1998 |title=Once and future celestial kings |journal=Sky and Telescope |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=59–63 |bibcode=1998S&T....95d..59T |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Once+and+future+celestial+kings-a020468305}}</ref>

Sirius&nbsp;A is about twice as massive as the [[Sun]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) and has an [[absolute visual magnitude]] of +1.43. It is 25&nbsp;times as luminous as the Sun,<ref name="Liebert2005"/> but has a significantly lower luminosity than other bright stars such as Canopus, [[Betelgeuse]], or [[Rigel]]. The system is between 200 and 300&nbsp;million years old.<ref name="Liebert2005"/> It was originally composed of two bright bluish stars. The initially more massive of these, Sirius&nbsp;B, consumed its hydrogen fuel and became a [[red giant]] before shedding its outer layers and collapsing into its current state as a white dwarf around 120&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name="Liebert2005"/>

Sirius is colloquially known as the "'''Dog Star'''", reflecting its prominence in its [[constellation]], [[Canis Major]] (the Greater Dog).<ref name="Allen1899"/> The [[heliacal rising]] of Sirius marked the [[flooding of the Nile]] in [[Ancient Egypt]] and the "[[dog days]]" of summer for the [[ancient Greeks]], while to the [[Polynesian people|Polynesians]], mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, the star marked winter and was an important reference for their navigation around the Pacific Ocean.

== Observational history ==
{{hiero|Sirius<br/>''{{lang|egy|[[wikt:spdt|Spdt]]}}''|<hiero>X1:N14-M44</hiero>|align=right}}
The brightest star seen from Earth, Sirius is recorded in some of the earliest astronomical records. Its displacement from the [[ecliptic]] causes its heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of almost exactly 365.25&nbsp;days holding it constant relative to the [[solar year]]. This rising occurs at [[Cairo]] on 19&nbsp;July ([[Julian calendar|Julian]]), placing it just before the onset of the [[flooding of the Nile|annual flooding]] of the [[Nile]] during antiquity.<ref name="Wendorf2001"/> Owing to the flood's own irregularity, the extreme precision of the star's return made it important to the [[ancient Egypt]]ians,<ref name="Wendorf2001"/> who worshipped it as the goddess [[Sopdet]] ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:spdt|Spdt]]}}, "Triangle";{{efn|
Compare the meaning of the Egyptian name with Sirius's completion of the [[Winter Triangle]] [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]], joining the other two brightest stars of the northern winter sky, [[Betelgeuse]] and [[Procyon]].}} {{lang-grc-gre|{{math|{{linktext|Σῶθις}}}}}}}, ''Sō̂this''), guarantor of the fertility of their land.{{efn|
As Sirius is visible together with the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], the Egyptians worshiped Orion as the god [[Sah (god)|Sah]], the husband of Sopdet, with whom she had a son, the sky god [[Sopdu]]. The goddess Sopdet was later [[syncretization|syncretized]] with the goddess [[Isis]], Sah was linked with [[Osiris]], and Sopdu was linked with [[Horus]]. The joining of Sopdet with Isis would allow [[Plutarch]] to state that "The soul of Isis is called Dog by the Greeks", meaning Sirius worshiped as Isis-Sopdet by Egyptians was named the Dog by the Greeks and Romans. The 70&nbsp;day period of the absence of Sirius from the sky was understood as the passing of Sopdet-Isis and Sah-Osiris through the [[duat|Egyptian underworld]].<ref name="Holberg2007-4-5"/>
}}

The [[ancient Greeks]] observed that the appearance of Sirius as the morning star heralded the hot and dry summer and feared that the star caused plants to wilt, men to weaken, and women to become aroused.<ref name="Holberg2007-19"/> Owing to its brightness, Sirius would have been seen to [[Scintillation (astronomy)|twinkle]] more in the unsettled weather conditions of early summer. To Greek observers, this signified emanations that caused its malignant influence. Anyone suffering its effects was said to be "star-struck" ({{lang|grc|{{math|ἀστροβόλητος}}}}, ''astrobólētos''). It was described as "burning" or "flaming" in literature.<ref name="Holberg2007-20"/> The season following the star's reappearance came to be known as the "dog days".<ref name="Holberg2007-16-17"/> The inhabitants of the island of [[Ceos]] in the [[Aegean Sea]] would offer sacrifices to Sirius and [[Zeus]] to bring cooling breezes and would await the reappearance of the star in summer. If it rose clear, it would portend good fortune; if it was misty or faint then it foretold (or emanated) pestilence. Coins retrieved from the island from the 3rd&nbsp;century BC feature dogs or stars with emanating rays, highlighting Sirius's importance.<ref name="Holberg2007-20"/>

The Romans celebrated the heliacal setting of Sirius around 25&nbsp;April, [[Animal sacrifice|sacrificing]] a dog, along with incense, wine, and a sheep, to the goddess [[Robigo]] so that the star's emanations would not cause [[Rust (fungus)|wheat rust]] on wheat crops that year.<ref name="Ovid"/>

Bright stars were important to the ancient [[Polynesians]] for navigation of the Pacific Ocean. They also served as latitude markers; the declination of Sirius matches the latitude of the archipelago of [[Fiji]] at [[17th parallel south|17°S]] and thus passes directly over the islands each [[sidereal day]].<ref name="Holberg2007-25"/> Sirius served as the body of a "Great Bird" constellation called ''Manu'', with Canopus as the southern wingtip and [[Procyon]] the northern wingtip, which divided the Polynesian night sky into two hemispheres.<ref name="Holberg2007-25-26"/> Just as the appearance of Sirius in the morning sky marked summer in Greece, it marked the onset of winter for the [[Māori people|Māori]], whose name ''Takurua'' described both the star and the season. Its culmination at the [[winter solstice]] was marked by celebration in [[Hawaii]], where it was known as ''Ka'ulua'', "Queen of Heaven". Many other Polynesian names have been recorded, including ''Tau-ua'' in the [[Marquesas Islands]], ''Rehua'' in New Zealand, and ''Ta'urua-fau-papa'' "Festivity of original high chiefs" and ''Ta'urua-e-hiti-i-te-tara-te-feiai'' "Festivity who rises with prayers and religious ceremonies" in Tahiti.<ref name=henry1907>{{cite journal|last=Henry|first=Teuira |author-link=Teuira Henry|date=1907|title=Tahitian Astronomy: Birth of Heavenly Bodies|journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society |volume=16|issue=2|pages=101–04|jstor=20700813}}</ref>

=== Kinematics ===
In 1717, [[Edmond Halley]] discovered the [[proper motion]] of the hitherto presumed ''[[fixed stars]]''<ref name="Aitken1942"/> after comparing contemporary [[astrometry|astrometric]] measurements with those from the second century AD given in Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]''. The bright stars [[Aldebaran]], [[Arcturus]] and Sirius were noted to have moved significantly; Sirius had progressed about 30 [[arcminutes]] (about the diameter of the Moon) to the southwest.<ref name="Holberg2007-41-42"/>

In 1868, Sirius became the first star to have its velocity measured, the beginning of the study of celestial [[radial velocities]]. Sir [[William Huggins]] examined the [[stellar spectrum|spectrum]] of the star and observed a [[red shift]]. He concluded that Sirius was receding from the Solar System at about 40&nbsp;km/s.<ref name="Daintith1994"/><ref name="Huggins1868"/> Compared to the modern value of −5.5&nbsp;km/s, this was an overestimate and had the wrong sign; the minus sign (−) means that it is approaching the Sun.<ref name="Hearnshaw2014">{{cite book |author=Hearnshaw, John B. |date=17 March 2014 |title=The Analysis of Starlight: Two centuries of astronomical spectroscopy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-03174-6 |page=88 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNbSAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA88}}</ref>

=== Distance ===
In his 1698 book, ''Cosmotheoros'', [[Christiaan Huygens]] estimated the distance to Sirius at 27,664&nbsp;times the [[Astronomical unit|distance from the Earth to the Sun]] (about 0.437&nbsp;light-year, translating to a parallax of roughly 7.5&nbsp;arcseconds).<ref>{{cite book |last=Huygens |first=C. |author-link=Christiaan Huygens |year=1698 |title={{math|ΚΟΣΜΟΘΕΩΡΟΣ}}, sive De terris cœlestibus earumque ornatu conjecturae |publisher=Apud A.

Scottish astronomer [[Thomas Henderson (astronomer)|Thomas Henderson]] used his observations made in 1832–1833 and South African astronomer [[Thomas Maclear]]'s observations made in 1836–1837, to determine that the value of the parallax was 0.23&nbsp;[[arcsecond]], and error of the parallax was estimated not to exceed a quarter of a second, or as Henderson wrote in 1839, "On the whole we may conclude that the parallax of Sirius is not greater than half a second in space; and that it is probably much less."<ref name=henderson>{{cite journal |last=Henderson |first=T. |author-link=Thomas Henderson (astronomer) |year=1839 |title=On the parallax of Sirius |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=5–7 |bibcode=1839MNRAS...5....5H |doi=10.1093/mnras/5.2.5 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Astronomers adopted a value of 0.25&nbsp;arcsecond for much of the 19th&nbsp;century.<ref name="Holberg2007-45"/> It is now known to have a parallax of nearly {{val|0.4|u=arcseconds}}.

The Hipparcos parallax for Sirius is only accurate to about {{±|0.04}}&nbsp;[[light year]]s, giving a distance of {{val|8.6|u=light years}}.<ref name=aaa474_2_653/> Sirius&nbsp;B is generally assumed to be at the same distance. Sirius&nbsp;B has a [[Gaia Data Release 3]] parallax with a much smaller statistical margin of error, giving a distance of {{val|8.709|0.005|u=light years}}, but it is flagged as having a very large value for astrometric excess noise, which indicates that the parallax value may be unreliable.<ref name=Gaia3/>

=== Discovery of Sirius B ===
[[File:Sirius A and B Hubble photo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hubble Space Telescope]] image of Sirius&nbsp;A and Sirius&nbsp;B. The white dwarf can be seen to the lower left. The [[diffraction spikes]] and concentric rings are [[Point spread function|instrumental effects]].]]

In a letter dated 10&nbsp;August 1844, the German astronomer [[Friedrich Bessel|Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] deduced from changes in the proper motion of Sirius that it had an unseen companion.<ref name="Bessel1844"/> On 31 January 1862, American telescope-maker and astronomer [[Alvan Graham Clark]] first observed the faint companion, which is now called Sirius&nbsp;B, or affectionately "the Pup".<ref name="Flammarion1877"/> This happened during testing of an {{convert|18.5|in|adj=on}} aperture [[great refractor]] telescope for [[Dearborn Observatory]], which was one of the largest refracting telescope lenses in existence at the time, and the largest telescope in the United States.<ref name=craig/> Sirius&nbsp;B's sighting was confirmed on 8&nbsp;March with smaller telescopes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862 |date=1863 |publisher=D. Appleton & Company |location=New York |page=176 |url=https://archive.org/stream/1862appletonsan02newyuoft#page/n183/mode/1up}}</ref>

The visible star is now sometimes known as Sirius&nbsp;A. Since 1894, some apparent orbital irregularities in the Sirius system have been observed, suggesting a third very small companion star, but this has never been confirmed. The best fit to the data indicates a six-year orbit around Sirius&nbsp;A and a mass of {{Solar mass|0.06}}. This star would be five to ten magnitudes fainter than the white dwarf Sirius&nbsp;B, which would make it difficult to observe.<ref name="Benest1995"/> Observations published in 2008 were unable to detect either a third star or a planet.

In 1985, German astronomers Wolfhard Schlosser and Werner Bergmann published an account of an 8th-century [[Lombardy|Lombardic]] manuscript, which contains ''De cursu stellarum ratio'' by St.&nbsp;[[Gregory of Tours]]. The Latin text taught readers how to determine the times of nighttime prayers from positions of the stars, and a bright star described as ''rubeola'' ("reddish") was claimed to be Sirius.

The possibility that [[stellar evolution]] of either Sirius&nbsp;A or Sirius&nbsp;B could be responsible for this discrepancy has been rejected by astronomers on the grounds that the timescale of thousands of years is much too short and that there is no sign of the nebulosity in the system that would be expected had such a change taken place.<ref name="Whittet1999"/> An interaction with a third star, to date undiscovered, has also been proposed as a possibility for a red appearance.<ref name="Kuchner2000"/> Alternative explanations are either that the description as red is a poetic metaphor for ill fortune, or that the dramatic [[scintillation (astronomy)|scintillations]] of the star when rising left the viewer with the impression that it was red.

Sirius can be observed in [[daylight]] with the naked eye under the right conditions. Ideally, the sky should be very clear, with the observer at a high altitude, the star passing overhead, and the Sun low on the horizon.

=== Sirius A ===
[[File:Sirius A-Sun comparison2.png|thumb|Comparison of Sirius&nbsp;A and the Sun, to scale and relative surface brightness]]

Sirius&nbsp;A, also known as the Dog Star, has a mass of {{Solar mass|2.063}}.<ref name=bond/><ref name="Liebert2005"/><ref name="Braganca2003"/> The radius of this star has been measured by an [[astronomical interferometer]], giving an estimated angular diameter of 5.936±0.016&nbsp;[[milliarcsecond|mas]]. The [[stellar rotation|projected rotational velocity]] is a relatively low 16&nbsp;km/s,<ref name="Royer2002"/> which does not produce any significant flattening of its disk.<ref name="Kervella2003"/> This is at marked variance with the similar-sized [[Vega]], which rotates at a much faster 274&nbsp;km/s and bulges prominently around its equator.<ref name="Aufdenberg2006"/> A weak [[magnetic field]] has been detected on the surface of Sirius&nbsp;A.<ref name=petit2011/>

Stellar models suggest that the star formed during the collapsing of a [[molecular cloud]] and that, after 10&nbsp;million years, its internal energy generation was derived entirely from nuclear reactions. The core became [[convection zone|convective]] and used the [[CNO cycle]] for energy generation.<ref name="Kervella2003"/> It is calculated that Sirius&nbsp;A will have completely exhausted the store of hydrogen at its core within a billion ({{10^|9}})&nbsp;years of its formation, and will then evolve away from the main sequence.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=Stellar mass and lifetime on the main sequence |medium=diagram |website=NASA's cosmos |url=https://ase.tufts.edu/cosmos/view_picture.asp?id=1406 |access-date=8 February 2021 }}</ref> It will pass through a [[red giant]] stage and eventually become a white dwarf.{{sfn|Brosch|2008|p=198}}

Sirius&nbsp;A is classed as a type {{nobr|[[Am star]],}} because the spectrum shows deep metallic [[absorption line]]s,<ref name=auriere2010/> indicating an enhancement of its surface layers in elements heavier than helium, such as iron.<ref name="SolStation"/><ref name="Kervella2003"/> The spectral type has been reported as {{nobr|A0mA1 Va,}} which indicates that it would be classified as A1 from hydrogen and helium lines, but A0 from the metallic lines that cause it to be grouped with the Am&nbsp;stars.<ref name=nstars/> When compared to the Sun, the proportion of iron in the atmosphere of Sirius&nbsp;A relative to hydrogen is given by <math chem>\textstyle\ \left[\frac{\ce{Fe}}{\ce{H}}\right] = 0.5\ ,</math><ref name="Qiu2001"/> meaning iron is 316% as abundant as in the Sun's atmosphere. The high surface content of metallic elements is unlikely to be true of the entire star; rather the iron-peak and heavy metals are radiatively levitated towards the surface.<ref name="Kervella2003"/>

=== Sirius B ===
[[File:Sirius B-Earth comparison2.png|thumb|Size comparison of Sirius B and Earth]]

Sirius&nbsp;B, also known as the Pup Star, is one of the most massive [[white dwarf]]s known. With a mass of {{Solar mass|1.02}}, it is almost double the {{Solar mass|0.5–0.6}} average. This mass is packed into a volume roughly equal to the Earth's.<ref name="Barstow2005"/> The current surface temperature is 25,200&nbsp;K.<ref name="Liebert2005"/> Because there is no internal heat source, Sirius&nbsp;B will steadily cool as the remaining heat is radiated into space over the next two billion years or so.<ref name="Imamura1995"/>

A white dwarf forms after a star has evolved from the main sequence and then passed through a [[red giant]] stage. This occurred when Sirius B was less than half its current age, around 120&nbsp;million years ago. The original star had an estimated {{Solar mass|5}}<ref name="Liebert2005"/> and was a [[B-type star]] (most likely B5V for {{Solar mass|5}})<ref name="Siess2000"/><ref name="Palla2005"/> when it was still on the main sequence, potentially burning around 600-1200 times more luminous than the sun. While it passed through the red giant stage, Sirius&nbsp;B may have enriched the [[metallicity]] of its companion, explaining the very high metallicity of Sirius&nbsp;A.

This star is primarily composed of a carbon–oxygen mixture that was generated by helium fusion in the progenitor star.<ref name="Liebert2005"/> This is overlaid by an envelope of lighter elements, with the materials segregated by mass because of the high surface gravity.<ref name="Koester1990"/> The outer atmosphere of Sirius&nbsp;B is now almost pure hydrogen—the element with the lowest mass—and no other elements are seen in its spectrum.<ref name="Holberg2004"/>

=== Apparent third star ===
{{redirect|Sirius C|the mythological star|Emme Ya}}
Since 1894, irregularities have been tentatively observed in the orbits of Sirius&nbsp;A and B with an apparent periodicity of 6–6.4&nbsp;years. A 1995 study concluded that such a companion likely exists, with a mass of roughly 0.05&nbsp;solar mass—a small [[red dwarf]] or large [[brown dwarf]], with an apparent magnitude of more than 15, and less than 3 arcseconds from Sirius A.<ref name="Benest1995"/>

More recent (and accurate) astrometric observations by the Hubble Space Telescope ruled out the existence of such a Sirius&nbsp;C entirely. The 1995 study predicted an astrometric movement of roughly 90&nbsp;[[Milliarcsecond|mas]] (0.09&nbsp;arcsecond), but Hubble was unable to detect any location anomaly to an accuracy of 5&nbsp;mas (0.005&nbsp;arcsec). This ruled out any objects orbiting Sirius&nbsp;A with more than 0.033&nbsp;solar mass (35&nbsp;Jupiter masses) orbiting in 0.5&nbsp;years, and 0.014 (15 Jupiter masses) in 2&nbsp;years. The study was also able to rule out any companions to Sirius&nbsp;B with more than 0.024&nbsp;solar mass (25&nbsp;Jupiter masses) orbiting in 0.5&nbsp;year, and 0.0095 (10&nbsp;Jupiter masses) orbiting in 1.8&nbsp;years. Effectively, there are almost certainly no additional bodies in the Sirius system larger than a small brown dwarf or large exoplanet.<ref name="siriusCruledout">{{cite news |last1=Andrew |first1=le&nbsp;Page |date=6 April 2017 |title=New Hubble observations of the Sirius system |website=drewexmachina.com |url=https://www.drewexmachina.com/2017/04/06/new-hubble-observations-of-the-sirius-system/ |access-date=21 March 2018}}</ref><ref name=bond/>

=== {{Anchor|Sirius supercluster}}Star cluster membership ===
In 1909, [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]] was the first to suggest that Sirius was a member of the [[Ursa Major Moving Group]], based on his observations of the system's movements across the sky. The Ursa Major Group is a set of 220&nbsp;stars that share a common motion through space. It was once a member of an [[open cluster]], but has since become gravitationally unbound from the cluster.<ref name="Frommert2003"/> Analyses in 2003 and 2005 found Sirius's membership in the group to be questionable: the Ursa Major Group has an estimated age of 500 ± 100&nbsp;million years, whereas Sirius, with metallicity similar to the Sun's, has an age that is only half this, making it too young to belong to the group.<ref name="Liebert2005"/><ref name="King2003"/><ref name="Croswell2005"/> Sirius may instead be a member of the proposed Sirius Supercluster, along with other scattered stars such as [[Beta Aurigae]], [[Alpha Coronae Borealis]], [[Beta Crateris]], [[Beta Eridani]] and [[Beta Serpentis]].<ref name="Eggen1992"/> This would be one of three large clusters located within {{convert|500|ly|pc}} of the Sun. The other two are the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] and the [[Pleiades]], and each of these clusters consists of hundreds of stars.<ref name="Olano2001"/>

=== Distant star cluster ===
{{Main|Gaia 1}}

In 2017, a massive star cluster was discovered only 10&nbsp;[[Minute and second of arc|arcminutes]] from Sirius, making the two appear to be [[Angular distance|visually close]] to one other when viewed from the point of view of the [[Earth]]. It was discovered during a statistical analysis of [[Gaia (spacecraft)|''Gaia'']] data.

==Cultural significance==
Many cultures have historically attached special significance to Sirius, particularly in relation to [[dog]]s. It is often colloquially called the "Dog Star" as the brightest star of [[Canis Major]], the "Great Dog" constellation. Canis Major was classically depicted as [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]]'s dog. The Ancient Greeks thought that Sirius's emanations could affect dogs adversely, making them behave abnormally during the "dog days", the hottest days of the summer. The Romans knew these days as {{lang|la|dies caniculares}}, and the star Sirius was called Canicula, "little dog". The excessive panting of dogs in hot weather was thought to place them at risk of desiccation and disease. In extreme cases, a foaming dog might have rabies, which could infect and kill humans they had bitten.<ref name="Holberg2007-20"/> [[Homer]], in the ''[[Iliad]]'', describes the approach of [[Achilles]] toward [[Troy]] in these words:<ref name="Homer"/>

Sirius rises late in the dark, liquid sky

And fevers to suffering humanity.

In a little-attested Greek myth, the [[Astra Planeta|star-god]] that personified Sirius fell in love with a fertility goddess named [[Opora (mythology)|Opora]], but he was unable to have her. Thus he began to burn hot, making humans suffer, who prayed to the gods. The god of the north wind, [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]], solved the problem by ordering his sons to deliver Opora to Sirius, while he cooled down the earth with blasts of his own cold wind.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | doi = 10.1163/1574-9347_bnp_e832290 | last = Käppel | first = Lutz | location = [[Kiel]] | date = 2006 | url = https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/opora-e832290 | title = Opora | encyclopedia = [[Brill's New Pauly]] | publisher = Brill Reference Online | editor-first1 = Hubert | editor-last1 = Cancik | editor-first2 = Helmuth | editor-last2 = Schneider | translator = Christine F.

In Iranian mythology, especially in [[Persian mythology]] and in [[Zoroastrianism]], the ancient religion of [[Persia]], Sirius appears as ''[[Tishtrya]]'' and is revered as the rain-maker divinity (Tishtar of [[New Persian]] poetry). Beside passages in the [[sacred texts]] of the [[Avesta]], the [[Avestan]] language ''Tishtrya'' followed by the version ''Tir'' in [[Middle Persian|Middle]] and New Persian is also depicted in the [[Persian literature|Persian]] epic ''[[Shahnameh]]'' of [[Ferdowsi]]. Because of the concept of the [[yazatas]], powers which are "worthy of worship", Tishtrya is a divinity of rain and fertility and an antagonist of [[apaosha]], the demon of drought.

In [[Chinese astronomy]] Sirius is known as the star of the "celestial wolf" ({{CJKV|t=天狼|s=天狼|j=天狼|}} [[Pinyin|Chinese romanization]]: Tiānláng; [[Romanization of Japanese|Japanese romanization]]: Tenrō;<ref name="Holberg2007-22"/> Korean and romanization: 천랑 /Cheonrang) in the [[Well (Chinese constellation)|Mansion of Jǐng]] (井宿). Many nations among the indigenous peoples of [[North America]] also associated Sirius with canines; the [[Seri people|Seri]] and [[Tohono Oʼodham]] of the southwest note the star as a dog that follows mountain sheep, while the [[Blackfoot]] called it "Dog-face". The [[Cherokee]] paired Sirius with [[Antares]] as a dog-star guardian of either end of the "Path of Souls". The [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] of Nebraska had several associations; the Wolf (Skidi) tribe knew it as the "Wolf Star", while other branches knew it as the "Coyote Star". Further north, the Alaskan [[Inuit]] of the [[Bering Strait]] called it "Moon Dog".<ref name="Holberg2007-23"/>

Several cultures also associated the star with a bow and arrows. The ancient Chinese visualized a large bow and arrow across the southern sky, formed by the constellations of [[Puppis]] and Canis Major. In this, the arrow tip is pointed at the wolf Sirius. A similar association is depicted at the [[Dendera Temple complex|Temple of Hathor]] in [[Dendera]], where the goddess [[Satet]] has drawn her arrow at [[Hathor]] (Sirius). Known as "Tir", the star was portrayed as the arrow itself in later Persian culture.<ref name="Holberg2007-24"/>

Sirius is mentioned in ''[[Surah]]'', ''[[An-Najm]]'' ("The Star"), of the [[Qur'an]], where it is given the name {{lang|ar|الشِّعْرَى}} (transliteration: ''aš-ši'rā'' or ''ash-shira''; the leader).<ref name="Staff2007"/> The verse is: "{{lang|ar|وأنَّهُ هُوَ رَبُّ الشِّعْرَى}}", "That He is the Lord of Sirius (the Mighty Star)." (An-Najm:49)<ref name="Quran"/> [[Ibn Kathir]] said in his commentary "that it is the bright star, named Mirzam Al-Jawza' (Sirius), which a group of Arabs used to worship".<ref name="tom1977"/> The alternate name ''Aschere'', used by [[Johann Bayer]], is derived from this.<ref name="Allen1899"/>

In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]], it is believed the ''Seven Stars of the [[Pleiades in folklore and literature|Pleiades]]'' transmit the [[spiritual energy]] of the [[Seven Rays#In Theosophy|Seven Rays]] from the ''Galactic Logos'' to the ''Seven Stars of the [[Ursa Major|Great Bear]]'', then to Sirius. From there is it sent via the Sun to the god of Earth ([[Sanat Kumara]]), and finally through the seven [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|Masters of the Seven Rays]] to the human race.<ref name="Baker1977"/>

The midnight [[culmination]] of Sirius in the northern hemisphere coincides with the beginning of the New Year<ref name="EarthSky2017">{{cite web |title=Sirius midnight culmination New Years Eve | date= 31 December 2017| url=https://earthsky.org/tonight/brightest-stars-midnight-culmination-new-years-eve | access-date=5 January 2022}}</ref> of the [[Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian Calendar]] during the decades around the year 2000. Over the years, its midnight culmination moves slowly, owing to the combination of the star's [[proper motion]] and the [[precession of the equinoxes]]. At the time of the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in the year 1582, its culmination occurred 17 minutes before midnight into the new year under the assumption of a constant motion. According to [[Richard Hinckley Allen]]<ref name="Allen1899p125">{{cite book |title=Star-names and Their Meanings|author=Allen, Richard Hinckley|year=1899 |publisher=G.E.

=== Dogon ===
{{See also|Nommo}}

The [[Dogon people]] are an [[ethnic]] group in [[Mali]], West Africa, reported by some researchers to have traditional astronomical knowledge about Sirius that would normally be considered impossible without the use of telescopes. According to [[Marcel Griaule]], they knew about the fifty-year orbital period of Sirius and its companion prior to western astronomers.<ref>{{cite book |first=Marcel |last=Griaule |title=Conversations with Ogotemmeli: An Introduction to Dogon Religious Ideas |year=1965|publisher=International African Institute |isbn=0-19-519821-2}} (many reprints) Originally published in 1948 as Dieu d'Eau.</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Marcel |last1=Griaule |first2=Germaine |last2=Dieterlen |title=The Pale Fox |publisher=Institut d'Ethnologie |year=1965}} Originally published as Le Renard Pâle.</ref>
