'''''Ender's Game''''' is a 1985 [[military science fiction]] novel by American author [[Orson Scott Card]]. Set at an unspecified date in Earth's future, the novel presents an imperiled humankind after two conflicts with an [[Insectoids in science fiction|insectoid]] [[Extraterrestrial life|alien species]] they dub "the [[Ender's Game (novel series)#Formics|buggers]]". In preparation for an anticipated third invasion, Earth's international military force recruits young children, including the novel's protagonist, [[Ender Wiggin|Andrew "Ender" Wiggin]], to be trained as elite officers. The children learn military strategy and leadership by playing increasingly difficult [[war games]], including some in [[Weightlessness|zero gravity]], where Ender's [[Military tactics|tactical]] [[genius]] is revealed.

The book originated as a short story [[Ender's Game (short story)|of the same name]], published in the August 1977 issue of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hatrack.com/osc/stories/enders-game.shtml|title=Short Stories by Orson Scott Card|year=2009|publisher=Hatrack River Enterprises Inc.|access-date=2009-01-03|archive-date=2020-02-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202160057/http://www.hatrack.com/osc/stories/enders-game.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref> The novel was published on January 15, 1985. Later, by elaborating on characters and plotlines depicted in the novel, Card wrote additional books in the [[Ender's Game (series)|''Ender's Game'' series]]. Card released an updated version of ''Ender's Game'' in 1991, changing some political facts to account for the then-recent [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and the end of the [[Cold War]]. The novel has been translated into 34 languages.

Reception of the book has been mostly positive. It has become suggested reading for many military organizations, including the [[United States Marine Corps]].<ref name="MarineC">{{cite web | url=http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=408059&sid=5775651 | title=Commandant's Professional Reading List - Primary Level Enlisted | website=Library of the Marine Corps | access-date=2017-01-09 | archive-date=2017-01-10 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110015130/http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=408059&sid=5775651 | url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Ender's Game'' was recognized as "best novel" by the 1985 [[Nebula Award]]<ref name="WWE-1985">{{cite web| url = http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1985| title = 1985 Award Winners & Nominees| work = Worlds Without End| access-date = 2009-07-15| archive-date = 2018-11-06| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181106215604/http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1985| url-status = live}}</ref> and the 1986 [[Hugo Award]]<ref name="WWE-1986">{{cite web| url = http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1986| title = 1986 Award Winners & Nominees| work = Worlds Without End| access-date = 2009-07-15| archive-date = 2016-04-11| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160411232428/https://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1986| url-status = live}}</ref> in the genres of science fiction and fantasy.

== Synopsis ==
{{Ender's Game chronology}}
War breaks out between humans and an insect-like alien race called the [[Formics]]. The humans achieve a narrow victory then create the International Fleet (I.F.) and train gifted children to become commanders at their orbiting Battle School.

[[Andrew "Ender" Wiggin]] is born a "Third": a rare exception to Earth's two-child policy, allowed by the government due to the promise shown by his two older siblings. The eldest, [[Peter Wiggin|Peter]], is an intelligent [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] who bullies Ender. His sister, [[Valentine Wiggin|Valentine]], is deeply empathic. The I.F. remove Ender's monitoring device when he is six years old, seemingly ending his chances of Battle School. He is bullied by a fellow student, Stilson, but Ender turns violent and attacks him. Stilson later dies from his wounds. Colonel [[Hyrum Graff]] visits Ender after hearing about the fight. Ender attests that by showing superiority now, he has prevented future struggle. Graff offers him a place in the Battle School.

Once at Battle School, Graff and the other leaders covertly work to keep Ender isolated. Ender finds solace in playing a simulated adventure game that involves being killed by and eventually killing a giant. The cadets participate in competitive war simulations in zero gravity, where Ender quickly masters the competition with novel tactics. To further wear Ender down, he is promoted to command a new army composed of raw recruits, then pitted against multiple armies at once, but Ender's success continues. Ender's jealous ex-commander, Bonzo Madrid, draws him into a fight outside the simulation, and once again seeking to preemptively stop future conflicts, Ender uses excessive force, and Bonzo dies from his injuries. 

Meanwhile on Earth, Peter Wiggin uses a global communication system to post political essays under the pseudonym "[[John Locke|Locke]]", hoping to establish himself as a respected orator and then as a powerful politician. Valentine, despite not trusting Peter, agrees to publish alongside him as "[[Demosthenes]]". Their essays are soon taken seriously by the government. 

Ender, now ten years old, is promoted to Command School. After some preliminary battles in the simulator, he is introduced to [[Mazer Rackham]], a hero from the Formic war who saw key patterns in the Formic behavior. Ender participates in space combat simulations created and controlled by Mazer. As the fighting become harder, he is joined by some of his friends from the Battle School as sub-commanders. Ender grows depressed by the battles, his isolation, and by the way Mazer treats him. 

For his final test, under observation by I.F.'s commanders, Ender finds his fleet far outnumbered by Formic ships surrounding their homeworld. He sacrifices his entire fleet to fire a Molecular Disruption Device at the planet. The Device destroys the planet and paralyzes the surrounding bugger fleet. The commanders cheer and celebrate. Mazer informs Ender that the "simulations" were real battles, directing human spacecraft against Formic fleets via an [[ansible]], and that Ender has won the war. Ender realizes that he has committed [[genocide]].

Ender and Valentine join a group of space colonists. On their new planet, Ender becomes the colony's governor. He discovers a structure that matches the simulation of the giant game from Battle School, and inside finds the dormant egg of a Formic queen. The queen telepathically communicates to Ender that before the first Formic war, they had assumed humans were a non-sentient race, for want of [[collective consciousness]], but realized their mistake too late. Instead, she had reached out to Ender to draw him here and requests that he take the egg to a new planet for the Formics to colonize.

Ender takes the egg and, with information from the queen, writes ''[[The Hive Queen (Ender's Game)|The Hive Queen]]'' under the alias "Speaker for the Dead". Peter, now the leader of Earth and age 77 with a failing heart, recognizes Ender as the author of ''The Hive Queen''. He asks Ender to write a book about him, which Ender titles ''[[Hegemon|The Hegemon]]''. The combined works create a new type of funeral, in which the Speaker for the Dead tells the whole and unapologetic story of the deceased, adopted by many on Earth and its colonies. Ender and Valentine leave the colony and travel to many other worlds, looking for a safe place to establish the unborn Hive Queen.

== Creation and inspiration ==
The original "[[Ender's Game (short story)|Ender's Game]]" is a [[short story]] that provides a small snapshot of Ender's experiences in Battle School and Command School; the full-length novel encompasses more of Ender's life before, during, and after the war, and also contains some chapters describing the political exploits of his older siblings back on Earth. In a commentary track for the 20th anniversary audiobook edition of the novel, as well as in the 1991 Author's Definitive Edition, Card stated that ''Ender's Game'' was written specifically to establish the character of Ender for his role of the Speaker in ''[[Speaker for the Dead]]'', the outline for which he had written before novelizing ''Ender's Game''.<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Card|first=Orson Scott|title=Ender's Game|publisher=Tor Books|location=New York|year=1991|edition=Author's definitive|chapter=Introduction|isbn=0-8125-5070-6|url=https://archive.org/details/endersgame00card_1}}</ref> Additionally, in the post-script of the 20th anniversary audiobook edition, Card mentions that he named Ender so that he could have a name that sounded like "[[Chess endgame|endgame]]" from chess.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Card |first=Orson Scott |title=Ender's Game Unabridged ed. |publisher=Macmillan Audio |year=2004 |location=New York, NY |pages=Author's Postscript |language=English |type=Audiobook}}</ref> In his 1991 introduction to the novel, Card discussed the influence of [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series]] on the novelette and novel. Historian [[Bruce Catton]]'s work on the [[American Civil War]] also influenced Card.<ref name="book" />

''[[The New York Times]]'' writer Gerald Jonas asserts that the novel's plot summary resembles a "grade Z, made-for-television, science-fiction rip-off movie", but says that Card develops the elements well despite this "unpromising material". Jonas further praises the development of the character [[Ender Wiggin]]: "Alternately likable and insufferable, he is a convincing little [[Napoleon]] in short pants."<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE2DF1339F935A25755C0A963948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1|title=SCIENCE FICTION|last=Jonas|first=Gerald|date=1985-06-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2009-01-11|archive-date=2021-11-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211105172954/https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/16/books/science-fiction.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The novel has received criticism for its portrayal of violence and its justification. [[Elaine Radford]]'s review, "Ender and Hitler: Sympathy for the Superman", posits that Ender Wiggin is an intentional reference by Card to [[Adolf Hitler]] and criticizes the violence in the novel, particularly at the hands of the protagonist.<ref name="Elaine-2">{{cite web|url=http://peachfront.diaryland.com/enderhitlte.html|title=Ender and Hitler: Sympathy for the Superman (20 Years Later)|last=Radford|first=Elaine|date=2007-03-26|publisher=Elaine Radford|access-date=2009-01-11|archive-date=2019-09-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190930091444/https://peachfront.diaryland.com/enderhitlte.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Card responded to Radford's criticisms in ''Fantasy Review'', the same publication. Radford's criticisms are echoed in [[John Kessel]]'s essay "Creating the Innocent Killer: Ender's Game, Intention, and Morality", wherein Kessel states: "Ender gets to strike out at his enemies and still remain morally clean. ''Nothing'' is his fault."<ref name="Kessel">{{cite web|url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/~tenshi/Killer_000.htm |title=Creating the Innocent Killer: Ender's Game, Intention, and Morality |last=Kessel |first=John |year=2004 |publisher=Science Fiction Foundation |access-date=2009-01-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227053817/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~tenshi/Killer_000.htm |archive-date=2008-12-27 }}</ref> Noah Berlatsky makes similar claims in his analysis of the relationship between colonization and science fiction, where he describes ''Ender's Game'' as in part a justification of "Western expansion and genocide".<ref name="Atlantic_SF_imperial">{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/04/why-sci-fi-keeps-imagining-the-enslavement-of-white-people/361173/ |title=Why Sci-Fi Keeps Imagining the Subjugation of White People |website=The Atlantic |date=April 25, 2014 |author=Noah Berlatsky |access-date=March 22, 2015 |archive-date=March 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316174827/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/04/why-sci-fi-keeps-imagining-the-enslavement-of-white-people/361173/ |url-status=live }}</ref> However, more recently, science fiction scholar Mike Ryder has refuted the claims of Kessel and Radford, arguing that Ender is exploited by powers beyond his control.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ryder |first1=Mike |title=The Literature of Drones: Ethics and Remote Killing in Ender’s Game |journal=Foundation: The International Review of Science Fiction |date=2023 |issue=144 |url=https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-literature-of-drones-ethics-and-remote-killing-in-enders-game(168852a0-ced2-42dd-b3bc-0cb913422754).html}}</ref>

== Revisions ==
In 1991, Card made several minor changes to reflect the political climates of the time, including the decline of the [[Soviet Union]]. In the afterword of ''[[Ender in Exile]]'' (2008), Card stated that many of the details in chapter 15 of ''Ender's Game'' were modified for use in the subsequent novels and short stories.  In order to more closely match the other material, Card has rewritten chapter 15 and plans to offer a revised edition of the book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.macmillan.com/enderinexile|title=Ender in Exile|access-date=2008-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401041300/http://us.macmillan.com/enderinexile|archive-date=2016-04-01|url-status=dead}} Audio edition, Macmillan Audio, Nov 2008</ref>

Card has called ''Ender's Game'' "[[unfilmable]]", "because everything takes place in Ender's head", and refused to sign a film deal unless he could ensure that the film was "true to the story". Of the film that he eventually agreed to, Card said it was "the best that good people could do with a story they really cared about and believed in", and while warning fans not to expect a completely faithful adaptation, called the film "damn good".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.neontommy.com/news/2013/04/orson-scott-card-enders-game-book-and-movie |title=Orson Scott Card Talks About 'Ender's Game' Book And Movie |work=Neon Tommy |date=2013-04-20 |access-date=2013-05-17 |archive-date=2013-05-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510110454/http://www.neontommy.com/news/2013/04/orson-scott-card-enders-game-book-and-movie |url-status=live }}</ref>
