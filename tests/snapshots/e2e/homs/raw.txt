Before the [[Syrian Civil War]], Homs was a major industrial centre, and with a population of at least 652,609 people in 2004,<ref>2004 census.</ref> it was the third-largest city in Syria after [[Aleppo]] to the north and the capital [[Damascus]] to the south. Its population reflected Syria's general religious diversity, composed of [[Sunni]] and [[Alawite]] Muslims, and [[Eastern Christianity|Christians]]. There are a number of historic mosques and churches in the city, and it is close to the [[Krak des Chevaliers]] castle, a [[World Heritage Site]].

Homs did not emerge into the historical record until the 1st century BC at the time of the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]]. It later became the capital of a kingdom ruled by the [[Emesene dynasty]] who gave the city its name. Originally a center of worship for the sun god [[Elagabalus (deity)|El-Gabal]], it later gained importance in [[Christianity]] under the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]. Homs was [[Siege of Emesa|conquered by the Muslims]] in the 7th century and made capital of a [[Jund Hims|district]] that bore its current name. Throughout the Islamic era, Muslim dynasties contending for control of Syria sought after Homs due to the city's strategic position in the area. Homs began to decline under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and only in the 19th century did the city regain its economic importance when its cotton industry boomed. During [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French Mandate]] rule, the city became a center of insurrection and, after independence in 1946, a center of [[Ba'ath Party|Baathist]] resistance to the first Syrian governments. During the [[Syrian civil war]], much of the city was devastated due to the [[Siege of Homs]]; reconstruction to affected parts of the city is underway with major reconstruction beginning in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.en.syria-scope.com/political-news/79683|title=11 Million Dollars for Reconstruction in Homs. – Syria Scope|website=www.en.syria-scope.com|access-date=3 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203153920/http://www.en.syria-scope.com/political-news/79683|archive-date=3 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://syriadirect.org/news/life-in-the-aftermath-a-wounded-homs-city-struggles-to-reconcile-its-past/|title=Life in the aftermath: A wounded Homs city struggles to reconcile its past|website=Syria Direct|access-date=16 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109153158/https://syriadirect.org/news/life-in-the-aftermath-a-wounded-homs-city-struggles-to-reconcile-its-past/|archive-date=9 November 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The origin of the city's modern name is that it is an [[Arabic]] form of the city's [[Latin]] name ''Emesus'', derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Émesa'' or ''Émesos'',<ref>Room, 2006, p. 167.</ref> or ''Hémesa''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Raphael Patai|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_p1CQAAQBAJ&pg=PA24|title=The Jews of Hungary: History, Culture, Psychology|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2015|page=24|isbn=9780814341926|access-date=14 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191230203204/https://books.google.com/books?id=o_p1CQAAQBAJ&pg=PA24|archive-date=30 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Most sources claim that the name ''Emesa'' in turn derived from the name of the nomadic Arab tribe known in Greek as ''Emesenoi'', who inhabited the region prior to Roman influence in the area.<ref name="Ball"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Kropp|first=Andreas J.

Other sources claim that the name ''Émesa'' or ''Hémesa'' was derived from that of the Aramean city of [[Hamath-zobah]], a combination of ''Hamath'' ({{lang-he|חֲמָת|Ḥamāth}}; {{lang-syr|ܚܡܬ|Ḥmṭ}}; "fortress") and ''Sawbah'' ({{lang-he|צובָא|links=no}}; {{lang-syr|ܨܘܒܐ|links=no}} ''Ṣwba''; "nearness").<ref>[https://glosbe.com/syc/en/%DC%A8%DC%98%DC%92%DC%90 ܨܘܒܐ in English] glosbe.com.</ref>{{better source needed|date=May 2020}} Thus, the name collectively means "The fortress surrounding" which refers to the [[Citadel of Homs]] and the encircling plains.<ref>{{cite book|author=Khoury Issa Ahmed|url=http://www.liilas.com/mlooli/tarekh-hms-1.pdf|title=History of Homs – Chapter One, 2300 BCE – 622 AD|publisher=Al-Sayih Library|language=ar|year=1983|page=38|access-date=9 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910041009/http://www.liilas.com/mlooli/tarekh-hms-1.pdf|archive-date=10 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city was subsequently referred to as {{lang|grc|Χέμψ}} (''Khémps'') in [[Medieval Greek]], and as "''la Chamelle''" (literally meaning "the female camel" in [[French language|French]] but likely a corruption of the Arabic name according to [[René Dussaud]]<ref>{{Cite book|author=René Dussaud|title=Topographie historique de la Syrie antique et médiévale|year=1927|quote=Le terme « vulgo » indique que Camela est tiré du vocable arabe Ḥimṣ.

==History==
{{for timeline}}

For approximately 2,000 years, Homs has served as a key agricultural market, production site and trade center for the villages of northern Syria. It has also provided security services to the [[hinterland]] of Syria, protecting it from invading forces.<ref name="Dumper1"/> Excavations at the [[Citadel of Homs]] indicate that the earliest settlement at the site dates back to around 2300 BCE. Biblical scholars have identified the city with [[Hamath-zobah]] of [[Zobah]] mentioned in the [[Bible]].<ref name="Dumper1"/><ref name="Cook"/> In 1274 BCE,<ref>around "Year 5 III Shemu day 9" of Ramesses II's reign (BAR III, p. 317) or more precisely: 12 May 1274 BCE based on Ramesses' commonly accepted accession date in 1279 BC.</ref> a [[Battle of Kadesh|battle]] took place between the forces of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egyptian Empire]] under [[Ramesses II]] and the [[Hittites|Hittite Empire]] under [[Muwatalli II]] at the city of [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]] on the [[Orontes River]] near Homs.<ref>Kitchen, K.A, "Ramesside Inscriptions", Volume 2, Blackwell Publishing Limited, 1996, pp. 16–17</ref> It was possibly the largest [[chariot]] battle ever fought, involving perhaps 5,000–6,000 chariots.<ref>Healy, 1993, p. 22</ref><ref>Healy, 1993, p. 39</ref>

[[Strabo]] only mentioned [[Al-Rastan|Arethusa]] in his ''[[Geographica|Geography]]'', as a "very strong place" of the Arab Sampsigeramos and of his son Iamblikhos, "phylarchs" of the Emesene, who had allied themselves to Q. Caecilius Bassus against Caesar in 47 BC; the translators above cited have thought strange Strabo's not saying a word about Emesa.<ref name="Strabon, p. 209, Henri Seyrig, p. 187">{{harvnb|Strabon|1819|p=209}}; {{harvnb|Seyrig|1952|p=187}}.</ref> Claims have been made that Emesa was founded by [[Seleucus I Nicator]] who established the [[Seleucid Empire]] upon the death of [[Alexander the Great]]. However, according to [[Henri Seyrig]], Emesa does not seem to have received any Greek colony and the authors' complete silence makes one think that it did not increase its visibility under the Seleucid kings.<ref>{{harvnb|Seyrig|1952|p=186}}.</ref> According to Henri Seyrig, it even seems that [[Posidonius]], to whom Strabo probably referred concerning the Emesenes' phylarchs' alliance with Q. Caecilius Bassus, regarded the Emesenes as a simple tribe, governed by its sheikhs, and still devoid of a real urban existence;<ref>{{harvnb|Seyrig|1952|p=187}}.</ref>{{efn|According to J. L.

The city of Emesa grew to prominence after the new-found wealth of the Emesene dynasty, governed first by one of the sons of Sampsiceramus I, [[Iamblichus (phylarch)|Iamblichus I]] who made it the kingdom's capital.<ref name="Ball"/> The Emesene proved their loyalty to Rome once more when they aided Gaius [[Julius Caesar]] in his siege of [[Alexandria]] in 48 BC, by sending him army detachments. Subsequently, they became embroiled in the [[Roman Civil War]] between the rebelling [[Mark Antony]] and the pro-Caesar [[Augustus|Octavian]]. Iamblichus I took the side of Octavian, and so upon encouragement from Antony, Iamblichus's brother [[Alexander (brother of Iamblichus I)|Alexander]] usurped the throne and put Iamblichus I to death in 31 BCE. Octavian's forces prevailed in the war, however, and as a result the kingdom's throne was reverted to [[Iamblichus II]] (the son of Iamblichus I) after Alexander was executed for treason. It was in 32 that [[Baalbek|Heliopolis]] and the [[Beqaa Valley]] came under the kingdom's control.<ref name="Ball"/> Relations with the Roman government grew closer when [[Sohaemus of Emesa|King Sohaemus]] inherited the kingship. Under him, Emesa sent the Roman military a regular levy of archers and assisted them in their [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|siege of Jerusalem]] in 70. Sohaemus had died in 73. According to [[Maurice Sartre]], the dynasty was very likely deprived of its kingdom, which was annexed to the [[Roman province of Syria]], between 72 and the date of the construction of the [[Tomb of Sampsigeramus]] (78–79).<ref name="Maurice Sartre, D'Alexandre à Zénobie : Histoire du Levant antique">{{harvnb|Sartre|2001}}.</ref>

Under the Romans, Emesa began to show attributes of a Greek [[city-state]] and traces of Roman town planning still remain. Its transformation into a major city was completed under the reign of Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] (138–161) when Emesa began to [[Mint (coin)#Ancient mints|mint coins]].<ref name="Dumper1"/> By the 3rd century, it grew prosperous and well integrated into the Roman Orient. This was partly due to the marriage of Emperor Lucius [[Septimius Severus]] to a woman from a family of notables based in Emesa. According to a text of [[Ulpian]] (''Digest'' 50.15.1.4) and another one of [[Paul (jurist)|Paul]] (''Digest'' 50.15.8.6), [[Caracalla]] and [[Elagabalus]] each promoted Emesa to the rank of a [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]] and granted ''[[ius Italicum]]'' to it; [[Eugène Albertini]] has hypothesized about a revocation by [[Macrinus]] of the privileges given by Caracalla and a reestablishment of those by Elagabalus.<ref>{{harvnb|Albertini|1934|pp=24–26}}.</ref> [[Elagabalus]] served as the high priest at the Temple of [[Elagabalus (deity)|El-Gebal]], the local Arab sun god.

Emesa also grew wealthy because it formed a link in the eastern trade funnelled through [[Palmyra]]; however, this dependence also caused the city's downfall when Palmyra sank to insignificance in the 4th century. Nonetheless, Emesa at this time had grown to rank with the important cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], [[Beirut]], and [[Damascus]]. It also continued to retain local significance, because it was the market center for the surrounding villages. The city remained a strong center of paganism, because of the Temple of El-Gabal. After one of his victories over [[Zenobia]], Emperor [[Aurelian]] visited the city to pay thanks to the deity.<ref name="Dumper"/>

Due to the strength of the pagan sun cult in Emesa, Christians initially did not settle in the city. [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] writes that Silvanus, the city's first bishop, had no jurisdiction over the city, but the surrounding villages. He was executed by [[Julian the Apostate|Emperor Julian]] and succeeded by Bishop Antonius—the first bishop to settle Emesa.<ref>Herbermann, 1913, p. 403.</ref> By the 5th century, [[Christianity]] was well established under the [[Byzantine Empire]]; however, few ancient Christian inscriptions exist in Homs today.<ref name="Dumper"/> Under the Byzantines, the city became an important center for [[Eastern Christianity]].<ref name="Carter2008-2"/> Initially a [[diocese]], Homs was given the status of [[ecclesiastical metropolis]] after the discovery of [[John the Baptist]]'s head in a nearby cave in 452.<ref name="Dumper"/> [[Nemesius]], who lived in the fourth or early fifth century AD, was the bishop of Emesa.<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0062%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DN%3Aentry+group%3D3%3Aentry%3Dnemesius-harpers Harry Thurston Peck, Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities (1898), Nemesius]</ref>

===Arab caliphates and dynasties===

Prior to the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]], [[Tribes of Arabia|Arab tribes]], particularly the [[Banu Kalb]], settled around Emesa, ensuring its position as an important [[Qays and Yaman tribes|Yamani]] center. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Heraclius]] abandoned the city—which served as his headquarters<ref>Kennedy, 2007, p. 74</ref>—after his army's defeat by the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun Muslims]] under Caliph [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] during the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] in southern Syria. In 637 CE, the [[Rashidun army]] led by [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] captured Emesa [[Siege of Emesa|peacefully]] because its inhabitants agreed to pay a substantial ransom of 71,000 to 170,000 [[dinar]]s.<ref name="Dumper">Dumper, 2007, p. 172.</ref><ref>Mannheim, 2001, p. 205.</ref><ref name="Hamawi"/> The caliph Umar established Homs as the capital of [[Jund Hims]], a district of the province of [[Bilad al-Sham]], encompassing the towns of [[Latakia]], [[Jableh]], and [[Tartus]] along the coast, [[Palmyra]] in the [[Syrian Desert]] and the territory in between, including the town of [[Hama]].<ref>le Strange, 1890, p. 25.</ref> Homs was likely the first city in Syria to have a substantial [[Islam|Muslim]] population.<ref>Kennedy, 2007, p. 86.</ref>

In 638, Heraclius sought help from the Christian Arab tribes who came from [[Upper Mesopotamia|al-Jazira]], particularly mainly from [[Circesium]] and [[Hit, Iraq|Hīt]] and the tribes mustered a large army and [[Siege of Emesa(638)|besieged Emesa]]. However the siege was a failure as the coalition forces lost heart and abandoned the city as at the time [[Iyad ibn Ghanm]] invaded their homeland in an effort to counter their act.<ref name="al Bidayah wa Nihayah Ibn Kathir">{{cite web |last1=Ibn Kathir |first1=Abu al-Fiḍā ‘Imād Ad-Din Ismā‘īl |title=Al Bidayah wa Nihayah |url=https://waqfeya.net/book.php?bid=11131 |website=Waqfeya |access-date=9 October 2021}}</ref><ref name="Zakkar, 1971">{{cite book |last1=Zakkar |first1=Suhayl |title=The Emirate of Aleppo: 1004–1094 |date=1971 |publisher=Dar al-Amanah |location=Aleppo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbltAAAAMAAJ}}</ref><ref name="Crone">{{Slaves on Horses}}</ref> 

The Muslims transformed half of St. John's Church into the city's Friday Mosque ([[Great Mosque of al-Nuri (Homs)|Great Mosque of al-Nuri]]) and Homs soon became a centre of [[Islam]]ic piety since some 500 [[Sahaba|companions]] of [[Muhammad]] settled there after its conquest.<ref name="Dumper"/> The tombs of Khalid ibn al-Walid, his son [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Khalid|Abd al-Rahman]], and [[Ubayd Allah ibn Umar|Ubayd Allah]], the son of Caliph Umar are located in the city.<ref>[[Ibn Jubair]] quoted in le Strange, 1890, p. 355.</ref> During the [[First Fitna|conflict]] between the [[Umayyad]]s and [[Ali]], the inhabitants of Homs allied themselves with Ali and when the latter was defeated, the Umayyad caliph [[Mu'awiyah]] hived the northern half of Jund Hims to form a separate district, [[Jund Qinnasrin]], apparently as punishment.<ref name="Dumper"/> Ali's oratory (''mashhad 'Ali'') was located in the city, and Islamic tradition claims his fingerprints are engraved on it.<ref name="Hamawi">[[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] quoted in le Strange, 1890, p. 356.</ref> Despite repression by the Umayyads, Homs remained a center of [[Shia Islam]] for a while longer.

The last Umayyad caliph, [[Marwan II]], enjoyed the support of the Qais and subsequently razed the city walls in response to a rebellion by the Banu Kalb.<ref name="Dumper"/>

In 750, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] wrested control of Syria, including Homs, from the Umayyads, and the Arab tribes revolted. Despite the prosperity Homs experienced during this era, Abbasid rule was generally not welcomed nevertheless. During and after the reign of Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] (796–809), the Abbasid authorities sent numerous punitive expeditions against Homs.<ref name="Dumper"/> Under the reign of Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]], in October 855, the Christian population [[Homs revolts (854–855)|revolted]] in response to [[jizya|additional taxation]]. The caliph put down the revolt by expelling Christians from the city, burning down their churches and executing members of their leadership.<ref>Gil, 1997, pp. 296–97.</ref>

With Abbasid rule over the Caliphate weakening in the mid-9th century, Homs became sought after by rebel dynasties contending for control of Syria due to the city's strategic position. Initially, the [[Egypt]]-based [[Tulunids]] came into control of it, but they were forced out by the [[Aleppo]]-based [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanids]], who were briefly succeeded by the [[Qarmatians]],<ref name="Dumper"/> after the latter's Turkish rebel ally [[Aftakin]] invaded northern Syria and established Homs as his base.<ref>Gil, 1997, p. 343.</ref> In 891 Muslim geographer [[al-Yaqubi]] noted that Homs was situated along a broad river which served as a source of drinking water for the inhabitants.<ref name="le Strange2"/> It was one of the largest cities in Syria and had several smaller districts surrounding it. In 944 the Hamdanids took definitive control of the city, dominating it until 1016.<ref name="Dumper"/> Arab geographer [[al-Mas'udi]] claimed in the early 10th century that Homs was "noted for the personal beauty of its inhabitants."<ref name="le Strange2">le Strange, 1890, p. 353.</ref> In 985, [[al-Muqaddasi]] noted that Homs was the largest city in all of Syria, but it had suffered "great misfortunes" and was "threatened with ruin." He stated that when the city was conquered by the Muslims they turned half of its church into a mosque.<ref>[[al-Muqaddasi]] quoted in le Strange, 1890, p. 354.</ref>

For around thirty years during the 10th century, Homs was raided by the Byzantines led by [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] in October 968, and its inhabitants were subject to slaughter and plunder while the city's mosque (Great Mosque of al-Nuri) was briefly restored as a church.{{sfn|Bosworth|2007|p=157}} In 974–975, [[John I Tzimiskes]] managed to control the city during his [[Syrian campaigns of John Tzimiskes|Syrian campaigns]].{{sfn|Romane|2015|p=73}}

Throughout most of the 11th century, the Byzantine raids receded greatly and the [[Mirdasid dynasty|Mirdasids]] of the [[Banu Kilab]] tribe ruled over Homs, replacing the Hamdanids. Inclined towards Shia Islam, they did not oppose the Shia [[Fatimid Caliphate]] of Egypt which was aiming to extend its rule into northern Syria and [[Iraq]] at the time. This precipitated a [[Sunni Muslim]] reaction led by the [[Saljuqid Turks]] who occupied Homs under the leadership of [[Aq Sunqur al-Hajib]] in 1090.<ref name="Dumper"/>

===Saljuqid, Ayyubid, and Mamluk rule===
{{See|Abbasid dynasty|Seljuk Sultanate|Ayyubids|Mamluk Sultanate}}
The [[First Crusade]] was launched in 1096, and in 1098, the Crusaders captured [[Antioch]] to the northwest, looted [[Ma'arrat al-Nu'man]], and finally besieged Homs itself. Although they managed to cut the city off from its main port [[Tartus]], they failed in taking the city. Soon after, Homs came under the control of the Saljuqid ruler of [[Damascus]], [[Duqaq (Seljuk ruler of Damascus)|Duqaq]], who transformed it into a large, fortified camp and key fortress effectively preventing the Crusaders from penetrating deeper into Muslim territory. Immune from attack, Homs became a point where the Muslims could marshal their forces and launch raids against Crusader holdings along the Mediterranean coast.<ref name="Dumper"/> In the early 12th century, the Saljuqids engaged in internal fighting, during which Homs was often a prize. In 1149 the [[Mosul]]-based [[Zangid]]s under [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur al-Din]] captured the city.<ref name="Dumper2">Dumper, 2007, p. 173.</ref>

Muslim geographer [[al-Idrisi]] noted in 1154 that Homs was populous, had paved streets, possessed one of the largest mosques in Syria, contained open markets, and was frequented by travellers attracted to its "products and rarities of all kinds." He also reported that its residents were "pleasant; living with them is easy, and their manners are agreeable. The women are beautiful and are celebrated for their fine skin."<ref>le Strange, 1890, p. 354.</ref> A series of earthquakes in 1157 inflicted heavy damage upon Homs and its fortress, then in 1170, a minor quake finished off the latter. However, because of its strategic importance, being opposite of the Crusader [[County of Tripoli]], the city and its fortifications were soon restored. In 1164, Nur al-Din awarded Homs to [[Asad ad-Din Shirkuh]] as a [[Iqta'|''iqtâ''']], but reclaimed it five years later following Shirkuh's death. The latter's nephew, [[Saladin]], occupied Homs in early December 1174, but the garrison at the citadel resisted.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=61}} He later departed for Aleppo, and left a small army in Homs' lower town.{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=98}} The defenders of the citadel offered to set their Christian prisoners free, if [[Raymond III, Count of Tripoli]] provided military assistance for them.{{sfn|Lewis|2017|p=239}} [[William of Tyre]] later emphasized that the commanders of the crusader army doubted if the defenders of the Homs citadel actually wanted to release their prisoners.{{sfn|Lewis|2017|p=240}} Saladin returned to Homs soon after he was informed about the negotiations between the crusaders and the garrison.{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=99}} Instead of attacking him, the crusader army retreated to Krak des Chevaliers;{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=99}} this enabled Saladin to capture the citadel on 17 March 1175.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=62}} In 1179, after reorganising his territories in northern Syria, Saladin restored Homs to his [[Ayyubid dynasty]]. Shirkuh's descendants retained Homs for nearly a century until 1262 with the death of [[al-Ashraf Musa, Emir of Homs|al-Ashraf Musa]]. In 1225, Arab geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] mentioned that Homs was large, celebrated and walled, having a strongly fortified castle on its southern hill.<ref name="Hamawi"/>

Towards the end of Ayyubid rule, Homs remained a centrepiece of the wars between them and the Crusaders, as well as internecine conflicts with the [[Mongol Empire]] and the [[Mamluk]]s.<ref name="Dumper2"/> The [[First Battle of Homs]] between the Mongols and the Mamluks took place on 10 December 1260, ending in a decisive Mamluk victory. The [[Second Battle of Homs]] was fought on 29 October 1281, also ending in a Mamluk victory. The Mamluks were finally defeated in the [[Battle of Wadi al-Khaznadar]], also known as the "Third Battle of Homs," in 1299.<ref name="Dumper2"/>

Homs declined politically after falling to the Mamluks under [[Baibars]] because their campaigns effectively drove out the Crusaders and the Mongols from the entirety of Syria. At the beginning of the 14th century, the city was merely the capital of the smallest province of Syria and was often attached to the province of Damascus.<ref name="Dumper2"/> [[Ibn Battuta|Ibn Batuta]] visited Homs in 1355, writing that it had fine trees, good markets, and a "fine Friday Mosque," noting that all of its inhabitants were Arabs.<ref>Ibn Batuta quoted in le Strange, 1890, p. 357.</ref> [[Timur]] seized the city in 1400.

===Ottoman rule===

In 1516, Homs was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] and consequently suffered a greater political eclipse, but it continued to thrive as an economic center, processing the agricultural and pastoral products that flowed to it from surrounding districts.<ref name="Collelo1">{{cite web|last=Collelo|first=Thomas|year=1987|url=http://countrystudies.us/syria/7.htm|title=Syria – Ottoman Empire|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|work=Syria: A Country Study|access-date=28 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613222335/http://countrystudies.us/syria/7.htm|archive-date=13 June 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Homs was particularly well known for [[silk]] and [[wool]] weaving, especially the ''alaja'', which was mottled [[muslin]] run through with gold threads and used in feminine apparel. This silk was exported as far as the Ottoman capital [[Istanbul]]. In addition to weaving industries, there were [[olive oil]] presses and water mills for [[wheat]] and [[sesame]], while [[grape]]s and [[rice]], grown in the surrounding marshlands from the 16th century, were found in abundance in the city's markets. Moreover, the markets of Homs were the center of a trade in livestock, where flocks of [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s coming from Aleppo met [[camel]]s and cattle moving north from Damascus.<ref name="Dumper2"/>

The coming of the Ottomans brought administrative changes to Homs, as it became the capital city of ''[[sanjak]]'' ("district") of [[Sanjak of Homs|Homs]], attached to the ''[[eyalet]]'' ("province") of [[Tripoli Eyalet|Tripoli]]—its old rival.<ref>Talhami, 2001, p. 2</ref> In the late 16th century the district was ruled by emir 'Ali Harfush of the famous Shiite [[Harfush dynasty]] of the nearby [[Beqaa valley]]. <ref>{{cite book|first=Stefan|last=Winter|title=The Shiites of Lebanon under Ottoman Rule, 1516-1788|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511676413 |isbn=9780511676413|url= https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511676413}}pp. 48-51</ref> Later, a [[French people|French]] visitor noted that the city walls and citadel were in good repair, but all within was in decay and only its covered markets "retained their beauty." In 1785 French traveller, [[Constantin-François Chassebœuf|Volney]] wrote of the city's once great importance and its current "miserable" condition. He described it as a large, but ruined village administratively dependent on Damascus. The Ottomans did little to revitalise Homs or ensure its security against Bedouin raids. Tribal unrest throughout the 17th and 18th centuries resulted in the sacking of its markets on several occasions. Security was even more hampered, when in the 18th century, the Ottomans tore down the gates of the city's walls.<ref name="Dumper2"/> Around 1708, the emir Hamad al-'Abbas of the Mawali Bedouin confederation, whom the Ottomans had named "emir of the desert" (''çöl beyi'') in the region, actually managed to capture the governor of Homs to hold him for ransom.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Stefan|last1=Winter|editor1-first=Stefan|editor1-last=Winter|editor2-first=Mafalda|editor2-last=Ade|title=Aleppo and its Hinterland in the Ottoman Period / Alep et sa province à l'époque ottomane|chapter=Alep et l’émirat du désert (çöl beyliği) au XVIIe-XVIIIe siècle|year=2019|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-37902-2}} p. 101-102.</ref>

The countryside of Homs saw an increase in Bedouin raids in the first half of the 19th century, interrupted by its occupation by [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|Muhammad Ali's Egypt]] led by [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] between 1832 and 1840.<ref name="Collelo1"/><ref>Shaw, 1977, p. 33</ref> The city rebelled against Egyptian rule and consequently, the citadel was destroyed when the Egyptians suppressed the revolt. Ottoman rule was soon restored and up to the 1860s, Homs was large enough to form a discrete economic unit of trade and processing of agricultural products from its satellite villages and the neighbouring Bedouin tribes.<ref name="Dumper2"/>

[[File:Ibn-Whalid-Moschee.jpg|thumb|[[Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque]], an example of [[Ottoman architecture]] in Homs, was built in the early 20th century]]
The local economy was stimulated when the Ottoman government extended security to the city and its surrounding areas; new villages were established and old ones were resettled. However, Homs found itself faced with European economic competition since Ottoman rule was restored. Homs' economic importance was boosted again during the depression of the 1870s, as its [[cotton]] industry boomed due to a decline of European textile production. The quality and design of cotton goods from Homs satisfied both the lower and upper classes of the local, Ottoman, and foreign markets. There were around 5,000 looms in Homs and nearby [[Hama]], and one British consul referred to Homs as the "[[Manchester]] of Syria."<ref name="Dumper2"/>

An oil pipeline between Tripoli and [[Kirkuk]] was built in Homs in the early 1930s and it followed an ancient caravan route between Palmyra and the Mediterranean.

===21st century===
From May 2011 – May 2014, the city was under [[Siege of Homs|siege]] by the Syrian Army and security forces. The Syrian government claims it is targeting "armed gangs" and "terrorists" in the area. According to the Syrian opposition, Homs has since become a "blighted city," where authorities regularly block deliveries of medicine, food and fuel to the inhabitants of certain districts. By June, there were near-daily confrontations between protesting residents and Syrian forces. As a result of these circumstances, there have been more deaths in Homs and its vicinity than in other areas of Syria. Homs was the first Syrian city where images of al-Assad and his family were routinely torn down or defaced and the first place where Syrian forces used artillery during the uprising. The Center for Documenting Violations in Syria claims that at least 1,770 people have been killed in Homs since the uprising began.<ref>[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2011/1076/re4.htm Capital of the Revolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217230844/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2011/1076/re4.htm |date=17 December 2011 }}.

==Geography==
[[File:Homs satellite.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite view]]
The [[Homs Governorate|Governorate of Homs]] is the largest in Syria. Homs, the governorate's capital, is located in central western Syria, situated along the east bank of the [[Orontes River]] in a particularly fertile area. The city is in between the southern outliers of the [[Syrian Coastal Mountain Range|Coastal Mountain Range]] located to the west and [[Mount Lebanon]], overlooking the [[Homs Gap]]. Because of the gap, the area around Homs receives much more rainfall and gusty winds than interior regions to its north and south.<ref name="commins"/> To the east of Homs, is the [[Syrian Desert]]. [[Lake Homs]], impounded by a [[Lake of Homs Dam|huge dam of Roman origins]], is to the southwest, lying some {{convert|125|km}} south of [[Aleppo]] and {{convert|34|km}} south of [[Hama]], halfway on the road between the capital Damascus and Aleppo.<ref name="Dumper1"/> The Orontes River splits the city into two main sections: To the east, on a flat land lies the city center and the main neighbourhoods; to the west, lies the more recent and modern suburb of al-Waer. The city spans an area of {{convert|4800|ha|sqmi}}.<ref name="CityCouncel">{{cite web|url=http://www.homscitycouncil.org.sy/modules/0/3.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518083543/http://www.homscitycouncil.org.sy/modules/0/3.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 May 2006 |title=Overview |publisher=Homs City Council |language=ar |year=2008 |access-date=28 February 2009 }}</ref>

Homs is located {{convert|162|km}} north of [[Damascus]], {{convert|193|km}} south of [[Aleppo]], {{convert|47|km}} south of [[Hama]], and {{convert|186|km}} southeast of [[Latakia]] on the Mediterranean coast.<ref name="Homsonline"/> Nearby towns and villages include [[Al-Rayyan, Syria|al-Rayyan]] to the southeast, [[Maskanah, Homs Governorate|Maskanah]], [[al-Nuqayrah]], [[Abil]] and [[Kafr Aya]] to the south, [[Al-Qusayr, Syria|al-Qusayr]], [[Qattinah]] and [[al-Buwaydah al-Sharqiyah]] to the southwest, [[Khirbet Tin Nur]] to the west, [[al-Dar al-Kabirah]] to the northwest, [[al-Ghantu]], [[Teir Maalah]], [[al-Mukhtariyah]] and [[Talbiseh]] to the north, [[al-Mishirfeh]] to the northeast and [[Fairouzeh]] and [[Zaidal]] to the east.

===Old City and subdivisions===
<!-- Commented out: [[File:Atassi-quarter.jpg|thumb|The [[Atassi]] quarter in the Old City of Homs]] -->
{{See also|Gates of Homs}}
{{Old City (Homs)}}
The Old City is the most condensed area of Homs, and it includes the neighbourhoods of Bab Tadmur, Bab al-Dreib, Bab Hud and the immediate vicinity of the citadel, covering an area of {{convert|1.2|km2}}.<ref name="CityCouncel"/> Little remains of the Old City; its walls and gates were demolished in the Ottoman era, but a short section of fortified wall with a circular corner tower still exists. Half a kilometre to the south, a large earth mound marks the site where the citadel once stood.<ref name="Carter1">Carter, 2004, p. 157.</ref> To the north of the citadel lies the Christian Quarter, known as "al-Hamidiyah".<ref name="div"/> This neighbourhood is one of the few areas of Homs that retains its older look, with most of the [[ablaq|alternating black-and-white]] stone buildings dating from the Mamluk era. They are still used as shops and dwellings, and there has been recent renovation.<ref>Carter, 2008, p. 157.</ref>

At the time of the Abbasids, Homs was known for its seven gates. They were Bab al-Souq (Gate of the Market), Bab Tadmur (Gate of [[Palmyra]]), Bab al-Dreib (or Bab al-Deir), Bab al-Sebaa (Gate of the Lions), Bab al-Turkman (Gate of the [[Turkoman (ethnonym)|Turkmen]]), Bab al-Masdoud (Closed Door), and Bab Hud (The Gate of [[Hud (prophet)|Hud]]).<ref name="Dumper2"/> Only two gates—Bab Tadmor and Bab al-Dreib—remain today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homsonline.com/EN/Citeis/Homs.htm|publisher=HomsOnline|title=Homs|year=2008|access-date=26 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516002653/http://www.homsonline.com/EN/Citeis/Homs.htm|archive-date=16 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The oldest of Homs' mosques and churches are located in the Old City.<ref name="Carter1"/>

Homs consists of several subdivisions outside the Old City. The large neighbourhood of Khaldiyah spreads along its northern edge which is bordered by [[Al-Bayadah]] and [[Deir Baalbah]], while the more modern neighbourhoods of al-Sabil, al-Zahra Jub al-Jandali and Armenian quarter are situated to the east of the Old City. South of it are the neighbourhoods of Bab al-Sebaa, al-Mreijeh, al-Adawiyya, al-Nezha, Akrama{{efn|The neighbourhood was named after [[Ikrima ibn Abi Jahl]].}} and beyond them lay the Karm al-Loz, Karm al-Zaytoun, Wadi al-Dhahab, al-Shamas, Masaken al-Idikhar and Dahia al-Walid neighbourhoods.<ref name="div"/> The modern commercial centre lies to the west in the neighbourhood of Jouret al-Shayyah, and further west are the upscale neighbourhoods of Qusoor, al-Qarabis, al-Baghtasia, al-Mahatta, al-Hamra, al-Inshaat, Karm al-Shami, al-Ghouta and [[Baba Amr]]. The suburb of al-Waer is located even further west, separated from the city by areas of farmland called al-Basatin and the Orontes River forming a [[green belt]] where it is forbidden to build anything.<ref name="div"/> The [[al-Baath University|Baath University]] complex and dormitories are located on the western-southern edge of the city next to the neighbourhood of Akrama.<ref name="div">{{cite web|url=http://www.homscitycouncil.org.sy/modules/0/2.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051213015220/http://www.homscitycouncil.org.sy/modules/0/2.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 December 2005 |publisher=Homs City Council |title=A Map of the divisions of Homs City |language=ar |access-date=26 February 2009 }}</ref>

===Climate===
Homs has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''Csa''').

Homs' location ensures that it receives softening influences and breezes from the Mediterranean. As a result, the city has a much milder climate than nearby Hama, with higher average rainfall of {{convert|18|in}} instead of {{convert|14|in}}, but it also experiences greater winds.<ref name="Dumper1"/>

After long periods of stagnation under [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman]] rule, Homs started to flourish again in the 20th century. Its geographic and strategic location has made it a centre of agriculture and industry. The "Homs Irrigation Scheme", the first of its kind in modern Syria, brought prosperity to cultivators and the long-established enterprises involved in the processing of agricultural and pastoral products.<ref name="Dumper3">Dumper, 2007, p. 174.</ref> Crops grown in Homs include [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[lentil]]s, [[sugar beet]]s, [[cotton]], and [[vine]]s, as well as serving as a point of exchange between the sedentary zone and the desert. Moreover, because of easy access to the Mediterranean, Homs has attracted overland trade from the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Iraq]].<ref name="commins"/>

[[File:Oil refinery in Homs, 2010.jpg|thumb|The oil refinery of Homs, built by Czechoslovakian firm Technoexport in 1959]]
Homs is also home to several large public heavy industries, such as the oil refinery west of the city which opened in 1959.<ref name="Dumper3"/> A fertiliser plant was built in 1971 to process [[phosphate]]s from their deposits near Palmyra; the fertiliser is for domestic consumption and export.<ref>Commins, 2004, p. 136.</ref> A growing private industrial sector has flourished in the past decade and many small to medium-sized enterprises occupy the industrial zones northwest and south of the city. A new [[sugar]] refinery is being built by a [[Brazil]]ian company, and an automobile plant is under construction by [[Iran Khodro]]. Also a new phosphate plant and oil refinery are being built east of the city. Homs is also the hub of an important road and rail network, it is the central link between the interior cities and the Mediterranean coast.

A major industrial project was the establishment of a new industrial city in [[Hisyah]], {{convert|47|km}} south of the city of Homs. Spreading across some {{convert|2500|ha|km2}}, the city covers four main industrial sectors: textiles, food, chemical, engineering and vocational. In all, the facilities are designed to accommodate up to 66,000 workers and their families.

===Cuisine===
[[File:Beit al-Agha Restaurant - Hims, Syria.jpg|thumb|left|Courtyard of Beit al-Agha restaurant]]

Although people in Homs eat the same foods common in [[Levantine cuisine]], the city is well known throughout Syria for its own cuisine. A prominent dish is ''Batarsh'', a type of [[Baba ghanoush|baba ghanouj]] made with yogurt and garlic instead of ''[[tahini]]''.<ref>Wright, 2003, p. 63.</ref> Homs is also home to a variety of ''kibbeh mishwiyyeh'' or "grilled kibbeh". It consists of two pancakes of ''[[kibbeh]]'' stuffed with ground lamb, cooked with lamb fat and various spices.<ref>Wright, 2003, p. 427.</ref> ''Jazar Mahshi'' ("stuffed carrot") is native dish in Homs and is made of yellow carrot stuffed with minced lamb, rice.<ref>Wright, 2003, p. 223.</ref> The city specialises in cooking a type of [[okra]] meal, known as ''bamya bi-l zayt'' ("okra with olive oil").<ref>Wright, 2003, p. 182.</ref>

Homs has an array of restaurants, some of the most highly acclaimed are those within the Safir Hotel: Mamma Mia and Mersia. The former specialises in [[Italian cuisine]], while the latter serves [[Arab cuisine|Arabic food]]. For the local population, popular restaurants include Prince Restaurant which acts as a type of fast-food place, serving ''[[shawarma]]'', grilled chicken, and other common Syrian foods, as well as homemade juices. In the Old City, low-price restaurants are grouped together along [[Quwatli Street|Shoukri al-Quwatly Street]] and sell similar foods, such as [[hummus]], [[falafel]], various salads (''[[mezze]]''), [[shish kebab]] and chicken dishes. Restaurants and coffeehouses typically offer [[hookah]]s and are a common place for men to gather and smoke.<ref>Carter, 2004, pp. 158–59.</ref> Other notable restaurants include Broasted Kreish, a local favourite for [[shish taouk]] and shawarma on the Korniche St just south of the Ghouta; the Rawda, a garden lounge located by the New Clock Tower which is known by locals for its Homsi-style [[fatteh]] and for the atmosphere created by its divided men and family areas, providing an area for men to gather to play cards, smoke and watch soccer games and for families to have a drink and dessert on late downtime.

Homs also recently emerged as the restaurant scene in pre-civil-war Syria after completing its Malab St. Hamra development. The Hamra Street in the Malab area was home to a strip of highly rated restaurants including La Luna, a [[Hookah lounge|shisha lounge]]; Chez Moi, serving a few French dishes along with the typical local food; Mia Casa, an Italian restaurant; Troy, an American-Latin-Syrian mashup; and Quattro, another Italian restaurant.

Like in Damascus and Aleppo, many houses in the Old City of Homs have been renovated and transformed into restaurants specialising in Levantine cuisine. Most notable of these is Beit al-Agha restaurant, situated in a renovated palace that dates back to the mid-19th century with [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman]] and [[Mamluk architecture|Mamluk]] architecture,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agha-syria.com/index2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711143935/http://agha-syria.com/index2.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 July 2009 |title=Beit al-Agha Restaurant |year=2006 |publisher=Beit al-Agha Restaurant |access-date=27 February 2009 }}</ref> and Julia Dumna Restaurant, which has been described as the best example of traditional Homsi houses, with its white and black stones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ehoms.sy/_places.php?filename=200812031455011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206071723/http://www.ehoms.sy/_places.php?filename=200812031455011 |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 December 2008 |publisher=eHoms |title=Julia Dumna Restaurant |year=2006 |language=ar |access-date=26 February 2009 }}</ref>

Historically, [[Wednesday]] was considered an important day for Homs citizens which is related to certain events happened in the history of the city. During the [[Royal family of Emesa|Emesani dynasty]] era, people who worshiped the sun god [[Elagabalus (deity)|Elagabalus]] held their [[liturgies]] at the great "Temple of the Sun" (currently [[al-Nouri mosque]]), celebrating the creation of the [[Sun]] on "the fourth day" of the divine workweek (The [[Book of Genesis|Creation narrative]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]).<ref>{{cite book|author=George Kadar|script-title=ar:أدب الـنـكـتـة، بـحـث في جـذور الـنـكـتـة الـحـمـصـيـة ، حـرب الأيـديـولـوجـيـا الـفـكـاهـيـة و لـيـتـورجـيـا الـمـجـانـيـن الـمـنـدثـرة| title= Adab al-nuktah, baḥth fī judhūr al-nuktah al-Ḥimṣīyah, ḥarb al-aydyūlūjiyā al-fukāhīyah wa-lītūrjiyā al-majānīn al-mundathirah |publisher=Dār Raslān |year=2009|language=ar}}</ref>

==Local infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Homs is considered a [[transportation hub]] in Syria, by virtue of its central location between the coastal cities and the interior.<ref>Mannheim, 2001, p. 204.</ref> The main bus terminal is Karnak, situated along Hama Street, {{convert|1.5|km}} north of the city centre on the outskirts. The terminal offers connections to most Syrian cities and [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]].<ref name="Carter2">Carter, 2004, p. 159.</ref> It also has international bus connections to Lebanon, [[Jordan]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Turkey]]. A second "luxury" bus station is located a little further north. [[Minibus]]es operate from Karnak station with destinations to [[Tartus]], [[Palmyra]], and [[Hama]] in northern Syria, as well as [[Baalbek]], Tripoli, and [[Beirut]] in Lebanon. Newer [[microbus]]es that mostly travel to Hama are also based in Karnak and are mostly used for quick transportation.

[[File:محطة القطارات - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|The railway station of Homs]]
Homs has a large [[railway]] station, with two [[Chemins de Fer Syriens]] operated daily departures to Damascus and Aleppo.<ref name="Carter2"/> The nearest airports are [[Bassel Al-Assad International Airport]] in [[Latakia]] to the west, [[Damascus International Airport]] to the south, [[Aleppo International Airport]] to the north, and [[Palmyra Airport]] in the Syrian Desert to the east.

Hama Street starts at the Old Clock Square in the city center and crosses Homs from south to north, where it continues along the neighbourhood of al-Khaldiyah on to the Karnak station, and turns into the Homs-Hama-Aleppo highway. [[Quwatli Street]], named after former president [[Shukri al-Quwatli]], is a short but vital street that connects the Old Clock Square and Quwatli Square in Downtown Homs. It branches into several smaller streets on its western end, one of which is al-Dablan Street which is the main commercial block in the city, and the other continues west to connect with the Homs-[[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] highway. On the eastern end, al-Quwatli street continues as al-Hamidiyah Street which crosses the old Christian quarter and continues to the eastern edge of the city. The Homs-Damascus highway crosses the city from the south and reaches the city center in Quwatli Square.<ref>Carter, 2008, p. 156.</ref>

===Landmarks===
{{multiple image|image1=The New Clock.jpg|caption1=The New Clock Tower, Quwatli Square|image2=The Old Clock.jpg|caption2=The Old Clock, Martyrs' Square}}

The city itself is famous for its historic [[mosque]]s and [[Church (building)|churches]]. It is also well recognised by its two public clocks standing at each end of [[Quwatli Street (Homs)|Quwatli Street]]. The older one, at the eastern end facing al-Hamidiya Street, was elevated by the [[French mandate of Syria|French]] in 1923, and the other one, at the western end facing al-Dablan street, is housed in the New Clock Tower which was built in 1957. Homs is well known for its historical roofed ''[[souk]]s''. These consist of a complex maze of narrow streets and covered commercial alleys extending from the south and east from the Great Mosque towards the ancient citadel. The ''souks''—lined with grocery and clothing stores, and workshops for carpenters, artisans, cobblers, metalworkers and knife-sharpeners—are busiest in the evening.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 207.</ref><ref>Carter, 2008, pp. 156–57.</ref>

Other landmarks include the [[Great Mosque of al-Nuri (Homs)|Great Mosque of al-Nuri]]. Originally a pagan temple dedicated to El-Gabal, it was consecrated as the Church of Saint John the Baptist under the Byzantines. Later, it was established as a Friday mosque during the Islamic Arab rule of Homs.<ref>Mannheim, 2001, p. 205–206.</ref> The [[Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque]] has been considered "the only edifice of any real note" in Homs, and was built in the last few years of Ottoman rule in Syria during the 1900s. The mosque is named after early Arab general Khalid ibn al-Walid, whose tomb is located within the building.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 53.</ref>

The [[Saint Mary Church of the Holy Belt|Um al-Zennar Church]] ("Church of the Virgin's Girdle") was built in 1852 atop an earlier church dating back to the 4th century, and perhaps 59 AD. The other prominent church in Homs is the 5th-century [[Church of Saint Elian]], built in honour of [[Christianity|Christian]] martyr Saint Elian, whose tomb is located in the [[crypt]].<ref name="Beattie, 2001, p.208"/>

The [[Citadel of Homs]] is situated on one of the largest urban [[Tell (archaeology)|tells]] of Syria. It has been archaeologically neglected because of military occupation until recent years. The tell dates back at least to the [[Early Bronze Age]]. The extant Islamic-style walls were built during the Ayyubid period and the Mamluk sultan [[Baybars]] subsequently carried out restorations. All of this work is testified by inscriptions although without exception, they are lost. In 1994, a joint Syrian-British team studied the Citadel of Homs, recording the remains of the walls and towers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=King |first=Geoffrey |title=Archaeological fieldwork at the Citadel of Homs, Syria: 1995–1999 |publisher=[[School of Oriental and African Studies]] |year=2002 |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=15222300 |access-date=17 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915183321/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=15222300 |archive-date=15 September 2012 |journal=Levant |volume=34 |pages=39–58 |doi=10.1179/lev.2002.34.1.39 |s2cid=162137882 }}</ref>
