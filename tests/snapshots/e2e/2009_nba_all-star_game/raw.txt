The [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] [[NBA All-Star Weekend Rookie Challenge|Rookie Challenge]] featured a team of standout first-year players ('[[Rookie]]s') against a team of standout second-year players ('Sophomores'). The game was divided into two twenty-minute halves, similar to [[college basketball]]. The participating players were chosen by voting among the league's assistant coaches. The Rookies team includes the first overall draft pick in [[2008 NBA draft]], [[Derrick Rose]]. The rest of the Rookies team consists of five of the top ten pick in the 2008 Draft and three players from the [[2007 NBA draft]] who were in their first NBA season. The three players are the first overall draft pick [[Greg Oden]] and two Spanish players [[Rudy Fernández (basketball)|Rudy Fernández]] and [[Marc Gasol]]. The Sophomores team features four players from [[2008 NBA All-Star Game#T-Mobile Rookie Challenge|the previous Rookie Challenge game]] which are [[Kevin Durant]], [[Jeff Green (basketball)|Jeff Green]], [[Al Horford]] and [[Luis Scola]].<ref name="Rookie">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2009/allstar2009/01/28/rookie_rosters.allstar09.012809/index.html|title=Durant, Rose among players in 2009 Rookie Challenge|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com|date=February 5, 2009|access-date=June 22, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212092611/http://www.nba.com/2009/allstar2009/01/28/rookie_rosters.allstar09.012809/index.html|archive-date=December 12, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The head coaches for the Rookies and Sophomores teams were the lead assistants from the 2009 NBA All-Star Game coaching staffs, [[Kurt Rambis]] from the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[John Kuester]] from the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. For the first time in the game's history, two active NBA players were selected as leading assistant coach. Two All-Star starters [[Dwyane Wade]] and [[Dwight Howard]] were selected as the assistant coaches for the Rookies and Sophomores team respectively.<ref name="Rookie"/>

This year, the first ever [[EA Sports]] Jersey Creator Contest was held to design the jerseys for both the rookie and the sophomore team. The contest called for the participants to come up with a [[computer graphics|computer-generated]] [[jersey (sports)|jersey]] design that would replace the individual team jerseys worn by the players during the Rookie Challenge. Of 12,000 participants, 18-year-old Tim Ahmed, a freshman at [[Baruch College]], won the contest. Ahmed won a free trip to Phoenix and a chance to meet players. This marks the first time that a fan-designed uniform has ever been worn during an NBA game or NBA event.<ref name="Rookie"/> The Sophomores wore fan-designed white jerseys and the Rookies wore fan-designed purple jerseys in the game.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/nyregion/26baruch.html|title = Baruch College Student Designs an N.B.A. Jersey and Wins Basketball Stardom|work=The New York Times|date=January 25, 2009|access-date=July 1, 2009|author=Mallozzi, Vincent M.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3906815|title=Durant's 46 power sophs past rookies|publisher=ESPN |date=February 14, 2009|access-date=June 30, 2009}}</ref>

Each contestant performed two [[slam dunk]]s in each round.

The panel of judges for this year contest consists of five former [[Phoenix Suns]] players, the inaugural Slam Dunk champion [[Larry Nance]], [[1992 NBA All-Star Game|1992]] champion [[Cedric Ceballos]], [[1987 NBA All-Star Game|1987]] [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star Game MVP]] [[Tom Chambers (basketball)|Tom Chambers]] and three-time All-Stars, [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]] and [[Dan Majerle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/suns/news/allstar09_dunk_judges_090214.html|title=Suns Greats Rate Dunks at All-Star Saturday Night|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com|date=February 14, 2009|access-date=June 17, 2009|author=Greene, Josh}}</ref>

Dwight Howard began his title defence with two 50-point dunks to advance to the final round with a perfect score. One of his dunks employed a 12-foot high hoop. Howard also used a prop [[phone booth]] to change into his [[Superman]] cape before completing the dunk on the 12-foot hoop. Nate Robinson also advanced to the final round with 87 points, beating Smith and Fernández who had 85 and 84 points respectively.<ref name="Dunk">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2009/allstar2009/02/15/main.20090214/index.html|title=Nate the Great takes flight over Superman to win title|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com|date=February 16, 2009|access-date=June 17, 2009|author=McMenamin, Dave|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211080406/http://www.nba.com/2009/allstar2009/02/15/main.20090214/index.html|archive-date=February 11, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In the final round, Robinson changed his uniform into the [[New York Knicks]]' green uniform originally designed for [[Saint Patrick's Day]]. The green uniform symbolized  [[Kryptonite]],<ref name="Dunk"/> a fictional substance known to have detrimental effects on Superman. The ''Krypto-Nate vs. Superman'' theme continued when Robinson, in his final dunk, used a green basketball and leaped over the 6'11" Howard who wore his Superman cape. Robinson ended up with 52% of fan vote to win his second dunk title. He joined [[Michael Jordan]], [[Dominique Wilkins]], [[Harold Miner]] and [[Jason Richardson]] as the only two-time winners of the contest.<ref name="Dunk"/>

On February 5, 2009, [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] announced the addition of [[Variations of basketball#H-O-R-S-E|H–O–R–S–E]] to its All-Star Weekend coverage. The competition was held outdoors on a half-sized court during the special ''[[Inside the NBA]]'' show prior to the All-Star Saturday Night events. The objective of this competition is to accrue as few of the five letters as possible. A player is given a letter every time they fail to duplicate the shot of another player. Each player was given 24 seconds to make or duplicate the shot (dunking was prohibited). Each player who fails to duplicate five shots was eliminated from the competition. An NBA referee was assigned to rule whether the shot was done properly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2009/allstar2009/02/03/tnt.HORSE/index.html|title=TNT to air H-O-R-S-E game featuring NBA players|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com|date=February 5, 2009|access-date=July 1, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106054125/http://www.nba.com/2009/allstar2009/02/03/tnt.HORSE/index.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
