'''Beryl May Dent''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|MIEE}} (10 May 1900{{Spaced ndash}}9 August 1977) was an English [[Mathematical physics|mathematical physicist]], technical librarian, and a programmer of early analogue and digital computers to solve electrical engineering problems. She was born in [[Chippenham]], Wiltshire, the eldest daughter of schoolteachers. The family left Chippenham in 1901, after her father became head teacher of the then recently established [[Warminster]] County School. In 1923, she graduated from the [[University of Bristol]] with [[British undergraduate degree classification#First Class Honours|First Class Honours]] in [[applied mathematics]]. She was awarded the [[Lilias Ashworth Hallett|Ashworth Hallett]] scholarship by the university and was accepted as a postgraduate student at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]].

She returned to [[Bristol]] in 1925, after being appointed a researcher in the Physics Department at the University of Bristol, with her salary being paid by the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]]. In 1927, [[John Lennard-Jones]] was appointed Professor of [[Theoretical physics]], a chair being created for him, with Dent becoming his research assistant in theoretical physics. Lennard{{Nbh}}Jones pioneered the theory of interatomic and intermolecular forces at Bristol and she became one of his first collaborators. They published six papers together from 1926 to 1928, dealing with the forces between atoms and ions, that were to become the foundation of her master's thesis. Later work has shown that the results they obtained had direct application to [[atomic force microscopy]] by predicting that non{{Hyphen}}contact imaging is possible only at small tip{{Hyphen}}sample separations.

In 1930, she joined [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] Electrical Company Ltd, Manchester, as a technical librarian for the scientific and technical staff of the research department. She became active in the [[ASLIB|Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux]] (ASLIB) and was honorary secretary to the founding committee for the Lancashire and Cheshire branch of the association. She served on various ASLIB committees and made conference presentations detailing different aspects of the company's library and information service. She continued to publish scientific papers, contributing [[Numerical analysis|numerical methods]] for solving [[differential equation]]s by the use of the [[differential analyser]] that was built for the [[University of Manchester]] and [[Douglas Hartree]]. She was the first to develop a detailed [[Total least squares#Scale invariant methods|reduced major axis]] method for the [[line fitting|best fit]] of a series of data points.

Later in her career she became leader of the computation section at Metropolitan{{Hyphen}}Vickers, and then a supervisor in the research department for the section that was investigating [[Semiconductor|semiconducting]] materials. She joined the [[Women's Engineering Society]] and published papers on the application of digital computers to electrical design. She retired in 1960, with [[Isabel Hardwich]], later a fellow and president of the Women's Engineering Society, replacing her as section leader for the women in the research department. In 1962, she moved with her mother and sister to [[Sompting]], West Sussex, and died there in 1977.

Dent's father was also a regular cast member of the Warminster Operatic Society at the Athenaeum and other venues. Dent and her younger sister, Florence Mary, would often appear with him on stage in such [[operetta]]s as [[Clara Louise Burnham|''Snow White and the seven dwarfs'']] and the ''Princess Ju{{Nbh}}Ju'' ([[Omamori|''The Golden Amulet'']]), a Japanese operetta in [[Three-act structure|three acts]] by Clementine Ward.{{R|"Warminster and Westbury Journal 29 February 1908"|"Wiltshire Times 28 November 1914"|"Howell 1987"}} In ''Princess Ju{{Nbh}}Ju'', she played ''La La'', one of the three maidens attendant on the princess, and sang the first act solo, ''She must be demure''.{{R|"Library of Congress 1902"|"Guide to Musical Theatre 2020"}} In act two of the same musical, she performed in the [[fan dance]], ''Spirits of the Night''.{{R|"Wiltshire Times 28 November 1914"|"Guide to Musical Theatre 2020"}}{{Efn|[[File:Warminster- some town-centre shops (geograph 2025490).jpg|95px|right|alt=Picture of the Market Place in Warminster|Market Place in Warminster]]At the end of the musical, the [[Kimigayo|national anthem of Japan]] was sung, followed by the British national anthem, and the flags of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] were waved from the stage.{{R|"Wiltshire Times 28 November 1914"}} The [[Flag of Belgium|Belgian flag]] was held by a young refugee, Alphonse Cambier, who, with three others, were attending the County School.{{R|"Wiltshire Times 28 November 1914"}} [[German invasion of Belgium (1914)|Germany had invaded Belgium]] on 4{{Nbsp}}August 1914, forcing Belgians to flee, with the United Kingdom home to 250,000 Belgian refugees during [[World War I]].

From 1909, Dent was educated at Warminster County School, where her father was head teacher.{{R|"Barnsley High School 1924"}} At school, she was close friends with her neighbour at Portway, Evelyn Mary Day, the eldest daughter of Henry George Day, a former butler to Colonel Charles Gathorne Gathorne{{Nbh}}Hardy, son of [[Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 1st Earl of Cranbrook]].{{R|"Wiltshire Times 12 June 1926"|"The Weald 1891"}}{{Efn|Dent was a bridesmaid at Evelyn's wedding to Maurice Philip Young, a pharmacist, at the Minster Church of St{{Nbsp}}Denys, Warminster, on 7{{Nbsp}}June 1926. At the time of her marriage, Evelyn was an assistant mistress at the Central County School, Church Road, [[Bexleyheath]]. Dent wore printed silk, with a shaded hat to match, and pink pearls, the gift of the bridegroom. She was known to friends and family as ''May Dent''.{{R|"Wiltshire Times 12 June 1926"}}}} In August 1914, she passed the [[Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations|University of Oxford Junior Local Examination]] with First Class Honours, and on the strength of her examination result, she was awarded a scholarship by the school.{{R|"Wiltshire Times 29 August 1914"|"Wiltshire Times 11 December 1915"}} In 1915, she passed the senior examination with second class honours and a distinction in French, and subsequently, her scholarship was renewed.{{R|"Wiltshire Times 11 December 1915"|"Wiltshire Times 7 August 1915"}} She then joined the [[sixth form]] and won the school prize for French in December 1916.{{R|"Wiltshire Times 16 December 1916"}}{{Efn|Dent's sister, Florence Mary, won the same prize for the year below.{{R|"Wiltshire Times 16 December 1916"}}}} In March 1918, she applied for a scholarship in mathematics from [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], one of the first two women's colleges in the [[University of Oxford]].

===University of Bristol (1919–1923)===
[[File:Paul Dirac, 1933.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of Paul Dirac taken in 1933|[[Paul Dirac]], Dent's fellow student on the honours course in mathematics at Bristol]]
In 1918, Dent joined the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) at [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], Hampshire.{{R|"Barnsley High School 1924"}} The [[World War I|First World War]] opened new employment opportunities for women, and RAE was one of the first military establishments to recruit women into engineering, and mathematical and computational research.{{R|1="Barrow‑Green 2014"|p1=116|2="Horrocks 2019"|p2=10}} In the same period that Dent was at RAE, [[Lorna Swain]], then mathematics tutor at [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]] in the [[University of Cambridge]], worked at the establishment on the problem of aircraft propeller vibration.{{R|"Barrow‑Green 2014"|p=84}} The [[Treasury#Treasury|Treasury]] reduced RAE's funding after the end of the war, and consequently, the number of resources and staff available to support research fell significantly.{{R|"Rood 2020"|p=58}} In 1919, she left RAE after being accepted on to the general [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) degree course at the [[University of Bristol]].{{R|"Barnsley High School 1924"}}{{Efn|The University of Bristol was the first higher education institute in England to admit women on an equal basis to men.{{R|"University of Bristol 2019"}}}} In June 1920, she passed her intermediate examination in French with supplementary courses in Latin, history, and mathematics.{{R|1="Western Daily Press 24 June 1920"|2="Staveley Barry 1921"|p2=1|q2=1919}}

In the following academic year, Dent joined the honours course in mathematics and took an intermediate examination in physics.{{R|1="Mehra Rechenberg 1982"|2="Staveley Barry 1921"|p2=1|q2=1919}} After spending the summer of 1921 at her parents' home in Warminster,{{R|"Wiltshire Times 30 July 1921"}} she returned for the start of the 1921 to 1922 academic year to find that [[Paul Dirac]] had joined the mathematics course.{{R|"Mehra Rechenberg 1982"}} The course of mathematics at Bristol University normally lasted three years, but because of Dirac's previous training, the Department of Mathematics had allowed him to join in the second year.{{R|"Mehra Rechenberg 1982"}} They were taught [[applied mathematics]] by Henry Ronald Hassé, the then head of the Mathematics Department, and [[pure mathematics]] by Peter Fraser. Both of them had come from Cambridge;{{R|"Mehra Rechenberg 1982"}} Fraser had been appointed in 1906 to the staff of the [[University College, Bristol|Bristol University College]], soon to become the University of Bristol, and Hassé joined him in 1919 as professor of mathematics.{{R|"Hodge 1959"||p=111}} Fraser introduced them to [[Rigour#Mathematical proof|mathematical rigour]], [[projective geometry]], and rigorous [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] in [[Calculus|differential and integral calculus]].{{R|"Mehra 2001"}} Dirac would later say that Peter Fraser was "the best teacher he had ever had."{{R|"Mehra Rechenberg 1982"}}

Dent studied four courses in pure mathematics:{{R|"Farmelo 2009"}}

There was a choice of specialisation in the final year; applied or pure mathematics. As the only official, registered fee{{Hyphen}}paying student, Dent had the right to choose, and she settled on applied mathematics for the final year. The department could offer only one set of lectures so Dirac also had to follow the same course.{{R|"Dalitz 1990"}}{{Efn|Her relations with Dirac were strictly formal; they seldom spoke to each other.{{R|"Farmelo 2009"}}}} Dent studied four courses in applied mathematics:{{R|"Farmelo 2009"}}

In 1928, Lennard{{Nbh}}Jones and Dent published two papers, "{{Citeref|Lennard‑Jones|Dent|1928|Cohesion at a crystal surface|style=plain}}", and with Sydney Chapman, "{{Citeref|Lennard‑Jones|Dent|Chapman|1928|The change in lattice spacing at a crystal boundary|style=plain}}", that studied the [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]] on a thin crystal [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]].{{R|"Weaver 1960"|"Davey 1934"}} Around this time, [[quantum mechanics]] was developed to become the standard formulation for [[atomic physics]].{{Efn|See the [[Solvay Conference#Fifth Conference|Fifth Solvay Conference]] in 1927.{{R|"Beenakker 2009"}}}} Lennard{{Nbh}}Jones left Bristol in 1929 to study the subject for a year as a [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller Fellow]] at the [[University of Göttingen]].{{R|"Lennard‑Jones 1929"}} She wrote one last paper before leaving the physics department at Bristol: "{{Citeref|Dent|1929|The effect of boundary distortion on the surface energy of a crystal|style=plain}}" (1929) examined the effect of the [[Polarization density|polarisation]] of surface ions in decreasing the [[Surface charge|surface energy]] of [[Alkali metal halide|alkali halide]]s.{{R|"Clark 1934"}} In November 1929, she was appointed to the position of technical librarian for the scientific and technical staff in the research department at [[Metropolitan-Vickers]], [[Trafford Park]], Manchester.{{Listref|iii|p=14{{Ndash}}15}}{{R|"Black Muddiman Plant 2007"|p2=193}}

In December 1929, Dent resigned her position at Bristol and it was accepted with regret by the [[university council]].{{R|"Western Daily Press 19 December 1929"}} Marjorie Josephine Littleton, the daughter of a local Bristol councillor and a graduate of Girton College, University of Cambridge, was appointed as her replacement on the 1{{Nbsp}}February 1930.

===Metropolitan-Vickers, Trafford Park (1930–1960)===
Metropolitan{{Hyphen}}Vickers was a British heavy industrial firm, well{{Hyphen}}known for industrial electrical equipment and generators, street lighting, electronics, [[steam turbine]]s, and diesel locomotives. They built the [[Metrovick 950]], the first commercial [[transistor computer|transistorised computer]].{{R|"Grace's Guide 2020"}} In 1917, a Research and Education Department was established at the Trafford Park site, when the care of the library came within the remit of James George Pearce. He made the library the centre of a new "technical intelligence" section.{{R|"Black Muddiman Plant 2007"|p=193}}{{Efn|Pearce was later appointed director and secretary of the British Cast Iron Research Association.{{R|"Black Muddiman Plant 2007"|p=226}}}} In the 1920s, the post of librarian was held by Lucy Stubbs, a former assistant librarian at the [[University of Birmingham]],{{R|"Thompson 2000"}} and past member of the first [[Committee#Standing committee|standing committee]] of [[ASLIB]].{{R|"Black Muddiman Plant 2007"|p=228}} Stubbs did not possess scientific qualifications, maintaining that a librarian, if assisted by other technical staff, did not need to understand science or engineering.{{R|"Black Muddiman Plant 2007"|p=193}} In 1929, James Steele Park Paton reorganised and expanded the section with Dent succeeding Stubbs as technical librarian on 6{{Nbsp}}January 1930.{{Listref|iii|p=15}}{{R|"Black Muddiman Plant 2007"|p2=193}} She joined the scientific and technical staff as was one of only two senior women in the research department,{{R|"Plant 2005"|p=314}} and in contrast to Stubbs, was employed principally for her technical skills.{{R|"Black Muddiman Plant 2007"|p=193}}

Dent was honorary secretary to the founding committee for the ASLIB Lancashire and Cheshire branch from 1931 to 1936.{{R|"Brightman 1956"|pp=204{{Ndash}}205}} In 1932, the branch had twenty{{Hyphen}}six members and had organised four meetings, including one addressed by Sir [[Henry Tizard]], the then President of ASLIB. After the war, it formed the basis for the Northern Branch of the association.{{R|"Muddiman 2005"|p=412}} Technical librarianship emerged as a new scientific career in [[interwar Britain]] and rapidly became one of the few types of professional industrial employment that was routinely open to both women and men.{{R|"Plant 2005"|p=301}} By 1933, Dent reported that the Metropolitan{{Hyphen}}Vickers library had three thousand engineering volumes and around the same number in pamphlets and patent specifications.{{R|"Philip 1933"}} Besides covering electrical subjects, the library covered accountancy, employment questions, and subjects of interest to the sales department. It also issued a weekly bulletin, scrutinised patents, handled patents taken out by research staff, and exchanged information with associated companies.{{R|"Barnard Roberts 1936"}}

Dent continued to publish papers in applied mathematics and contribute to papers on emerging computational technologies. In "{{Citeref|Dent|1935|On observations of points connected by a linear relation|style=plain}}" (1935), she developed a detailed [[Total least squares#Scale invariant methods|reduced major axis]] method for line fitting that built on the work of Robert Adcock and Charles Kummell.{{R|"Smith 2009"|"Choudhary Nagaraja 2017"}} In 1937, David Myers, then at the [[Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford#Buildings|Engineering Laboratory]] at the University of Oxford, asked [[Douglas Hartree]] and [[Arthur Porter (engineer)|Arthur Porter]] to calculate the [[space charge]] limitation of [[Current transformer|secondary current]] in a [[triode]].{{R|1="Porter 2003"|p1=91|2="Froese Fischer 2003"|p2=96}} The calculations relied on some initial numerical integrations that were carried out by Dent on a [[differential analyser]]. The results corresponded closely to those obtained experimentally by Myers at Oxford.{{R|1="Porter 2003"|p1=91|2="Froese Fischer 2003"|p2=97}} Her knowledge of higher mathematics meant that she was asked to check the mathematics in papers for publication by engineers at Metropolitan{{Hyphen}}Vickers. For example, Cyril Frederick Gradwell, a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, asked her to scrutinise the algebraic part of his work in "{{Citeref|Gradwell|1950|The Solution of a problem in disk bending occurring in connexion with gas turbines|style=plain}}" (1950).{{Sfn|Gradwell|1950|p=212}}{{Efn|Along with Dent, Cyril Gradwell was one of the first programmers of the Ferranti Mark 1 computer.

The causes of axial spreading of the [[charged particle]] beam during extraction were also analysed.{{R|"Hoffman Whitehead 1954"}}

Dent joined the [[Women's Engineering Society]] and published papers on the application of digital computers to electrical design.{{R|"The Woman Engineer Summer 1948"}}{{Sfn|Dent|1957}} With Brian Birtwistle, she wrote programs for the [[Ferranti Mark 1]] (Mark 1) computer at the [[University of Manchester]], that demonstrated that high speed digital computers could provide considerable assistance to the electrical design engineer.{{Sfn|Birtwistle|Dent|1956a|pp=52{{Ndash}}53}} Birtwistle would later have an extensive career in the computer industry, working at, amongst others, [[Honeywell#Honeywell Information Systems|Honeywell Information Systems]] and [[ADP, Inc.|ADP Network Services]].{{R|"Peltu 1977"}} In 1958, she carried out computer calculations for the mechanical engineering team at the Nuclear Power Group, [[Radbroke Hall]]. Their paper outlined a procedure for calculating the theoretical deflection (bending) of a circular grid of support girders for a graphite [[neutron moderator]] in a [[gas-cooled reactor]].{{Sfn|Edwards|Gill|Perkins|1958|p=1402}} A general expression was derived from the central deflection of the grid and the maximum [[bending moment]] on the central cross{{Hyphen}}beam for a range of grid diameters.{{R|"Building Research Station 1959"}}

In 1959, and a year from retirement, Dent modelled a proposed [[Switched-mode power supply#Non-isolated topologies|Zeta circuit]] on the Mark 1 computer, for Eric Hartill's paper on constructing a high{{Hyphen}}power pulse transformer and circuit.{{Sfn|Hartill|1959|pp=66, 73}} The cost of the computation was about two thousand pounds ({{Inflation|UK|2000|1959|fmt=eq|r=-3|cursign=£}}), corresponding to around eighty hours of machine time.{{Sfn|Hartill|1959|p=68}} She retired from Metropolitan{{Hyphen}}Vickers in May 1960, with [[Isabel Hardwich]], later a fellow and president of the Women's Engineering Society, replacing her as section leader for the women in the research department.{{R|1="Black Muddiman Plant 2007"|p1=232|2="Jackson 2016"|p2=243}}

===Atomic force microscopy===
[[File:Atomic force microscope by Zureks.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of an atomic force microscope on the left with controlling computer on the right|An atomic force microscope on the left with controlling computer on the right. Dent's work had direct application to the development of [[atomic force microscopy]]]]
In 1928, Lennard{{Nbh}}Jones and Dent published two papers, "{{Citeref|Lennard‑Jones|Dent|1928|Cohesion at a crystal surface|style=plain}}" and "{{Citeref|Lennard‑Jones|Dent|Chapman|1928|The change in lattice spacing at a crystal boundary|style=plain}}", that for the first time, outlined a calculation of the [[Electric potential|potential of the electric field]] in a vacuum, produced by a thin sodium chloride crystal surface.{{R|"Weaver 1960"|"Davey 1934"}} They gave an expression for the electric potential produced by a system of [[Point particle#Point charge|point charges]] in vacuum (although not a real cubic sodium chloride ionic lattice).{{R|"Dorofeev Vinogradov 2012"|pp=796{{Ndash}}797}} The expression for the potential in vacuum, <math>\varphi_{0}\left(r\right)</math>, at the point r = {x, y, z}, ''near'' the cubic lattice of point ions with different signs, the charge <math>e_{k}</math>, and the period ''a'' (a crystalline solid is distinguished by the fact that the atoms making up the crystal are arranged in a periodic fashion), can be represented in the form:{{R|"Dorofeev Vinogradov 2012"|p=797}}

{{NumBlk|:|
<math>
 \varphi_{0}\left(r\right)=
 \frac{2\pi}{a^{2}}
 \sum_{l,m}\sum_{s}
 \frac{\left(-1\right)^{s}

 \right]}
 {\left|k_{l,m}\right|}
 \times
 \sum_{k}e_{k}\cos
 \left[k_{l,m}\left(r_{\parallel}-r_{k}\right)\right]
</math>
|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

:<math>r_{\parallel}=\left\{x,y\right\}</math> is the lateral vector that fixes the observation point coordinates in the sample plane.
:<math>k_{l,m}</math> is the [[reciprocal lattice]] vector.
:''s'' is the number of planes to be calculated inside the crystal; ''s'' set to zero would calculate the surface plane.

The expression sums the set of potential static charges for the surface and lower planes of the crystal lattice. Lennard{{Nbh}}Jones and Dent showed that this expression forms a rapidly convergent [[Fourier series]].{{R|"Dorofeev Vinogradov 2012"|p=797}} Harold Eugene Buckley, a crystallographic researcher at the University of Manchester until his death in 1959,{{R|"Deer 1961"|p=481}} had suggested that their results should be treated with caution. For example, the contraction a crystal plane would suffer under the conditions prescribed would not be the same as that of a similar plane with a solid mass of crystal behind it. Another difficulty arises because calculation of crystal surface field force fields are so great that simplifying assumptions have to be made to render them capable of a solution.{{R|"Buckley 1951"}}

Michael Jaycock and Geoffrey Parfitt, then respectively senior lecturer in [[Surface science|surface and colloid chemistry]] at [[Loughborough University|Loughborough University of Technology]] and professor of [[chemical engineering]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], concurred with Buckley, noting that "an ideal crystal, in which the ionic positions at the surface were identical to those achieved in the bulk crystal{{Nbsp}}... is obviously extremely improbable." However, they acknowledged that the Lennard{{Nbh}}Jones and Dent model was singularly elegant, and like most researchers working before the advent of modern computers, they were limited in what could be attempted computationally.{{R|"Jaycock Parfitt 1981"}} Nonetheless, Lennard{{Nbh}}Jones and Dent demonstrated that the force exerted on a single ion, by a surface with evenly distributed positive and negative ions, decreases very rapidly with increasing distance.{{R|"Jensen Lannung 1943"|p=14}} Later work by Jason Cleveland, Manfred Radmacher, and [[Paul K. Hansma|Paul Hansma]], has shown that this result has direct application to [[atomic force microscopy]] by predicting that non{{Hyphen}}contact imaging is possible only at small tip{{Hyphen}}sample separations.{{R|"Cleveland Radmacher Hansma 1995"|p=543}}

===Reduced major axis regression===
[[File:linear regression.svg|thumb|alt=Graph with x and y axes showing scattered points with a line of best fit|[[Linear regression]] attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation (straight line) to observed data]]
The theoretical underpinnings of standard [[linear regression|least squares regression]] analysis are based on the assumption that the independent variable (often labelled as ''x'') is measured without error as a design variable. The dependent variable (labeled ''y'') is modeled as having uncertainty or error. Both independent and dependent measurements may have multiple sources of error. Therefore, the underlying least squares regression assumptions can be violated. Reduced major axis (RMA) regression is specifically formulated to handle errors in both the ''x'' and ''y'' variables.{{R|"Harper 2014"|p=1}} If the estimate of the ratio of the error variance of ''y'' to the error variance of ''x'' is denoted by ''{{Lambda}}'', then the reduced major axis method assumes that ''{{Lambda}}'' can be approximated by the ratio of the total variances of ''x'' and ''y''.{{R|"Mark 1984"}} RMA minimizes both vertical and horizontal distances of the data points from the predicted line (by summing areas) rather than the least squares sum of squared vertical (''y''{{Hyphen}}axis) distances.{{R|"Harper 2014"|p=2}}

In Dent's 1935 paper on linear regression, entitled "{{Citeref|Dent|1935|On observations of points connected by a linear relation|style=plain}}", she admitted that when the variances in the ''x'' and ''y'' variables are unknown, "we cannot hope to find the true positions of the observed points, but only their most probable positions."{{Sfn|Dent|1935|p=93|loc=Footnote}} However, by treating the probability of the errors in terms of [[Error function|Gaussian error function]]s, she contended that this expression may be regarded as "a function of the unknown quantities", or the [[likelihood function]] of the data distribution.{{R|"Burt 1949"|p=106|q=Note 1}} Furthermore, she argued that [[Arg max|maximising]] this function to obtain the [[maximum likelihood estimation]],{{R|"Fienberg 2006"|p=5}} subject to the condition that the points are [[Collinearity|collinear]], will give the parameters for the line of best fit. She then deduced formulae for the errors in estimating the [[centroid]] and the line inclination when the data consists of a single (unrepeated) observation.{{R|"Burt 1949"|p=106|q=Note 1}}

[[Maurice Kendall]] and Alan Stuart showed that the maximum likelihood estimator of a likelihood function, depending on a parameter <math>\theta</math>, satisfies the following [[quadratic equation]]:{{R|"Kendall Stuart 1967"}}

{{NumBlk|:|
<math>\theta^{2}x^{T}y+\left[\lambda x^{T}x-y^{T}y\right]\theta-\lambda x^{T}y=0</math>
|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

:where ''x'' and ''y'' are the <math>\mathbf{X}</math> and <math>\mathbf{Y}</math> [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] in a [[covariance matrix]] giving the [[covariance]] between each pair of ''x'' and ''y'' variables.

Using the [[quadratic formula]] to solve for the positive [[Zero of a function|root (or zero)]] of ({{EquationNote|2}}):{{R|"Diewert Fox 2008"|p=183|q=Note 34}}
{{NumBlk|:|
<math>\theta_{ML}\equiv\frac{y^{T}y-\lambda x^{T}x+\sqrt{(y^{T}y-\lambda x^{T}x)^{2} + 4\lambda (x^{T}y)^{2}}}{2x^{T}y}</math>
|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Inspection of ({{EquationNote|3}}) shows that as ''{{Lambda}}'' tends to plus infinity, the positive root tends to:{{R|"Diewert Fox 2008"|p=183}}
{{NumBlk|:|
<math>\theta_{x}</math>, equal to <math>\frac{x^{T}y}{x^{T}x}</math>
|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

Correspondingly, as ''{{Lambda}}'' tends to zero, the root tends to:{{R|"Diewert Fox 2008"|p=183}}
{{NumBlk|:|
<math>\theta_{y}</math>, equal to <math>\frac{y^{T}y}{x^{T}y}</math>
|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

Dent had solved the maximum likelihood estimator in the case where the covariance matrix is not known.{{R|"Villegas 1961"|p=1049}} Dent's maximum likelihood estimator is the [[geometric mean]] of <math>\theta_{x}</math> and <math>\theta_{y}</math>, equivalent to:{{R|"Diewert Fox 2008"|p=184|q=Note 37}}

{{NumBlk|:|
<math>\theta_{ML}\equiv\sqrt{\frac{x^{T}y}{x^{T}x}\times{\frac{y^{T}y}{x^{T}y}}}\equiv\sqrt{\frac{{y^{T}y}}{{x^{T}x}}}</math>, where <math>x^{T}y</math> is positive.
|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

[[Dennis Lindley]] repeated Dent's analysis and stated that Dent's geometric mean estimator is not a consistent estimator for the likelihood function,{{R|"Lindley 1947"|pp=235{{Ndash}}236, 241}} and that the gradient of the estimate will have a bias, and this remains true even if the number of observations tends to infinity.{{R|"Jansen Barrett 1978"|p=15}} Subsequently, [[Theodore Wilbur Anderson|Theodore Anderson]] pointed out that the likelihood function has no maximum in this case, and therefore, there is no maximum likelihood estimator.{{R|"Anderson 1976"|p=3}} Kenneth Alva Norton, a former consulting engineer with the then [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Bureau of Standards]], responded to Lindley, stating Lindley's own methods and assumptions lead to a biased prediction.{{R|"Norton 1957"}} Furthermore, Albert Madansky, now H. G. B. Alexander professor emeritus of business administration at [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]],{{R|"Chicago Booth 2022"}} noted that Lindley took the wrong root for the quadratic in ({{EquationNote|2}}) for the case where <math>x^{T}y</math> is negative.{{R|"Madansky 1959"|pp=201{{Ndash}}203}}

[[Richard J. Smith]] has stated that Dent was the first to develop a RMA regression method for line fitting that built on the work of Robert Adcock in "{{Citeref|Adcock|1878|A Problem in Least Squares|style=plain}}" (1878) and Charles Kummell in "{{Citeref|Kummell|1879|Reduction of observation equations which contain more than one observed quantity|style=plain}}" (1879).{{R|"Smith 2009"|"Choudhary Nagaraja 2017"}} It is now believed that she was the first to propose what is often called the geometric mean functional relationship estimator of slope,{{R|"Barker 1989"|"Sprent 1990"}} and that her essential arguments can be generalised to any number of variables.{{R|"Burt 1949"|p=106|q=Note 1}} Moreover, although her solution has its theoretical limitations, it is of practical importance, as it likely represents the best [[a priori estimate]] if nothing is known about the true error distribution in the model. It is generally much less reasonable to assume that all the error, or residual scatter, is attributable to one of the variables.{{R|1="Mark 1984"|2="Jansen Barrett 1978"|p2=3}}

===Electrical design using digital computers ===
[[File:Transformer-hightolow smaller.jpg|thumb|alt=Illustration of transformer showing copper windings|Illustration of [[Transformer#Windings|transformer windings]]]]
In the 1950s, British electrical engineers would rarely use a digital computer, and if they did, it would be to solve some complicated equation outside the scope of [[analog computer|analogue computers]]. To a certain extent, engineers were deterred by the difficulty and the time taken to program a particular problem. Furthermore, the varied and often unique problems that arise in electrical design practice, together with the degree of uncertainty of the numerical data of many problems, accentuated this tendency.{{Sfn|Birtwistle|Dent|1956a|p=47}} On 10 April 1956, Dent and Brian Birtwistle presented their paper, "{{Citeref|Birtwistle|Dent|1956a|The digital computer as an aid to the electrical design engineer|style=plain}}", to the Convention on Digital Computer Techniques at the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]].{{Sfn|Birtwistle|Dent|1956a|p=47}} The paper was intended to show, by describing three relatively simple applications, that the digital computer could be a useful aid to the electrical design engineer. The three example problems were:{{Sfn|Birtwistle|Dent|1956a|pp=47{{Ndash}}48}}

{{Ordered list
| [[Overvoltage|Impulse voltage]] distribution on transformer windings.
| Supply frequency [[Ripple (electrical)|ripple]] on [[transductor]] performance.
| Starting [[torque]] of a [[Electric motor#Synchronous motor|synchronous motor]].
}}

The Ferranti Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester was used for the calculations in the three problems. Dent was allowed to use the university's [[Library (computing)|library]] of [[Function (computer programming)|subroutines]], from which the following were taken and incorporated into the programs:{{Sfn|Birtwistle|Dent|1956a|p=48}}

The first problem of calculating the impulse voltage distribution on transformer windings took about five hours of machine time. Conversely, a hand calculation, using a method described by Thomas John Lewis in "{{Citeref|Lewis|1954|The Transient Behaviour of Ladder Networks of the Type Representing Transformer and Machine Windings|style=plain}}" (1954), took around three months.{{R|"Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineer 1956"|p=486}} The use of a computer in the second problem allowed for a more accurate solution as it was possible to include [[Magnetic hysteresis|nonlinear magnetic]] characteristics in the calculation. In the last problem, the torque and speed curves for the synchronous motors were calculated in around fifteen minutes.{{R|"Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineer 1956"|p=486}} Their paper was one of the first to recognise that high speed digital computers could provide considerable assistance to the electrical design engineer by carrying out automatically the optimum design of products.{{Sfn|Birtwistle|Dent|1956a|pp=52{{Ndash}}53}}

Significant research had been devoted to determining a transformer's internal [[Surge protector#Transient voltage suppressor|transient voltage]] distribution. Early attempts were hampered by computational limitations encountered when solving large numbers of coupled differential equations with analogue computers.{{R|"Degeneff 2004"}} It was not until Dent, with Hartill and Miles, in "{{Citeref|Dent|Hartill|Miles|1958b|A method of analysis of transformer impulse voltage distribution using a digital computer|style=plain}}" (1958), recognised the limitations of the analogue models and developed a digital computer model, and associated program, where non{{Hyphen}}uniformity in the [[Transformer#Windings|transformer windings]] could be introduced and any input voltage applied.{{Sfn|Dent|Hartill|Miles|1958b|p=259}}

The surface plane of a [[Cubic crystal system|face{{Hyphen}}centred cubic lattice]] was derived by Lennard{{Nbh}}Jones and Dent and this result has been used extensively in [[physisorption]] studies. They simplified the calculation of the [[Lennard-Jones potential]] by noting that the ions under study were [[Isoelectronicity|isoelectronic]] with [[inert gas]] atoms, and thus, there was no need to introduce additional [[Empirical research|empirical]] ''L{{Nbh}}J'' parameters into the equation.
In rock{{Hyphen}}salt or [[sodium chloride]] ([[halite]]) structure, each of the two atom types forms a separate face{{Hyphen}}centred cubic lattice. Examples of compounds with this structure include sodium chloride itself, along with the other alkali halides, and [[Valence (chemistry)|divalent]] metal oxides, [[sulfide|sulphide]]s, [[selenide]]s, and [[Telluride (chemistry)|tellurides]].{{R|1="Sammis 1972"|p1=16|2="Seitz 1940"|3="Ben‑Ephraim Folman 1984"|p3=682{{Ndash}}683}}
