'''''Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace''''' is a 1999 American [[Epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] film written and directed by [[George Lucas]]. It stars [[Liam Neeson]], [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Jake Lloyd]], [[Ahmed Best]], [[Ian McDiarmid]], [[Anthony Daniels]], [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]], [[Pernilla August]], and [[Frank Oz]]. It is the fourth film in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series, the first film of the [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]] and the first chronological chapter of the "[[Skywalker Saga]]". Set 32 years before the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original trilogy]], (13 years before the formation of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]), during the era of the [[Galactic Republic]], the plot follows [[Jedi]] Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his apprentice [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] as they try to protect [[Padmé Amidala|Queen Padmé Amidala]] of [[Naboo]] in hopes of securing a peaceful end to an interplanetary trade dispute. Joined by [[Anakin Skywalker]]—a young slave with unusually strong natural powers of [[the Force]]—they simultaneously contend with the mysterious return of the [[Sith]]. The film was produced by [[Lucasfilm]] and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]].

Following the release of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), talks of a follow-up were proposed, but Lucas was unmotivated to return to the franchise. During the hiatus, the backstories he created for the characters, particularly Anakin's own backstory, sparked interest in him to develop a prequel trilogy during the 1990s. After he determined that [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) had advanced to the level he wanted for the prequel trilogy's [[visual effect]]s, Lucas began writing ''The Phantom Menace'' in 1993, and production began in 1994. Filming started on June 26, 1997—at locations including [[Leavesden Film Studios]] and the Tunisian desert—and ended on September 30.  The film marked Lucas' first directorial effort after a 22-year hiatus following the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''{{EpIV}} in 1977.

''The Phantom Menace'' was released in theaters on May 19, 1999, almost 16 years after the premiere of ''Return of the Jedi''. The film's premiere was extensively covered by media and was widely anticipated because of the large cultural following the ''Star Wars'' saga had cultivated. Upon its release, ''The Phantom Menace'' received mixed reviews from critics. While the visual effects were praised, its exposition and characters—particularly [[Jar Jar Binks]]—received criticism. The movie was a box-office success and broke numerous box-office records during its debut. It grossed more than $924.3 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run, becoming the [[1999 in film|highest-grossing film of 1999]], the [[List of highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film]] worldwide and [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|in North America]] (behind ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''), and the highest-grossing ''Star Wars'' film at the time (inflation notwithstanding). A 3D reissue, which earned an additional $102.7 million and brought the film's overall worldwide takings to over $1 billion, was released in February 2012. ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002) and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005) followed ''The Phantom Menace'', rounding out the ''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy.

== Plot ==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->
The Trade Federation upsets order in the [[Galactic Republic]] by [[Blockade|blockading]] the planet [[Naboo]] in secret preparation for a full-scale [[invasion]]. The Republic's leader, Supreme Chancellor [[Finis Valorum]], dispatches [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his apprentice, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], to negotiate with Trade Federation Viceroy [[Nute Gunray]]. [[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]], a [[Sith|Sith Lord]] and the Trade Federation's secret benefactor, orders the Viceroy to kill the Jedi and begin their invasion with an army of [[battle droid]]s. The Jedi escape and flee to Naboo. During the invasion, {{nowrap|Qui-Gon}} rescues a bumbling [[Gungan]] outcast, [[Jar Jar Binks]]. Indebted to {{nowrap|Qui-Gon}}, {{nowrap|Jar Jar}} leads the Jedi to Otoh Gunga, the Gungans' underwater city. The Jedi fail to persuade the Gungan leader, [[Boss Nass]], to help the planet's surface dwellers, but manage to obtain {{nowrap|Jar Jar's}} guidance and underwater transport to Theed, the capital city of Naboo. After rescuing [[Padmé Amidala|Queen Padmé Amidala]], the group make their escape from Naboo aboard her Royal Starship, intending to reach the Republic capital planet of [[Coruscant]].

Passing through the Federation blockade, the ship is damaged in the crossfire and its hyperdrive malfunctions. The group land for repairs on the outlying desert planet of [[Tatooine]], situated beyond the Republic's jurisdiction. Qui-Gon, Jar Jar, [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]], and Padmé—disguised as one of her handmaidens—visit the settlement of Mos Espa to purchase a new part for their hyperdrive. They encounter a junk dealer, [[Watto]], and his nine-year-old slave, [[Anakin Skywalker]], a gifted pilot and engineer who has built a [[protocol droid]], [[C-3PO]].
Qui-Gon senses a strong presence of [[the Force]] within Anakin, and is convinced that he is the prophesied "[[Chosen One (Star Wars)|Chosen One]]," destined to restore balance to the Force. With Watto refusing to accept payment in Republic currency, {{nowrap|Qui-Gon}} wagers both the required hyperdrive part and Anakin's freedom in a [[podrace]]. Anakin wins the race and joins the group to be trained as a Jedi, leaving behind his mother, [[Shmi Skywalker|Shmi]]. En route to their starship, {{nowrap|Qui-Gon}} is attacked by [[Darth Maul]], Sidious' apprentice, who was sent to capture Amidala. After a brief [[lightsaber]] duel, {{nowrap|Qui-Gon}} escapes on board the starship with the others.

Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan escort Padmé to Coruscant so that she can plead her people's case to Valorum and the [[Galactic Senate]]. {{nowrap|Qui-Gon}} asks the [[Jedi Council]] for permission to train Anakin as a Jedi, but the Council refuses, concerned that Anakin is vulnerable to the dark side of the Force. Undaunted, {{nowrap|Qui-Gon}} vows to take up Anakin as his new apprentice. Meanwhile, Naboo's Senator [[Palpatine]] persuades Amidala to call for a [[vote of no confidence]] in Valorum to elect a more capable leader and to resolve the crisis. Though she is successful in pushing for the vote, Amidala grows frustrated with the corruption in the Senate and decides to return to Naboo. {{nowrap|Qui-Gon}} and {{nowrap|Obi-Wan}} are ordered by the Jedi Council to accompany the queen and investigate the return of the Sith, whom they had believed to be extinct for more than a millennium.

On Naboo, Padmé reveals herself as the queen before the Gungans and persuades them to join in an alliance against the Trade Federation. {{nowrap|Jar Jar}} is promoted to general and joins his tribe in a battle against the droid army, while Padmé leads the search for Gunray in Theed. During a battle in the hangar, Anakin flees to a starfighter and accidentally triggers its [[autopilot]], traveling to the battle against the Federation droid control ship and inadvertently causing its destruction from within, deactivating the droid army. Meanwhile, Darth Maul infiltrates the Theed Palace and engages {{nowrap|Qui-Gon}} and {{nowrap|Obi-Wan}} in a lightsaber duel, Maul mortally wounds Jinn before being bisected by Obi-Wan and falling down a shaft.{{Efn|The 2008 animated television series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' establishes that Maul survived.}} Qui-Gon asks Obi-Wan to train Anakin before dying in his arms.

Following the battle, Gunray is arrested by the Republic and Palpatine is elected Chancellor. Grandmaster [[Yoda]] promotes {{nowrap|Obi-Wan}} to the rank of Jedi Knight and reluctantly accepts Anakin as {{nowrap|Obi-Wan's}} apprentice. A funeral is held for Qui-Gon, attended by the other Jedi, who contemplate that there is still one Sith remaining. During a celebratory parade on Naboo, Padmé presents a gift of thanks to Boss Nass and the Gungans to establish peace.

* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], a [[Jedi Master]] who discovers Anakin Skywalker and under the belief that he is destined to bring balance to the force as the prophesied "Chosen One", insists that the boy be trained as a Jedi, despite the Jedi Council's refusal to do so. Lucas originally wanted to cast an American actor in the role, but cast Neeson (who is [[Northern Irish]]) because he considered that Neeson had great skills and presence. Lucas said Neeson was a "master actor, who the other actors will look up to, who has got the qualities of strength that the character demands."<ref name="ProductionNotes" />
* [[Ewan McGregor]] as [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], Qui-Gon's twenty-five-year-old Jedi Padawan, who holds his master in high regard but questions his motives at times, especially when it seems he is breaking the rules of the Jedi. McGregor was cast from a shortlist of fifty actors, all of whom had to be compared to pictures of young [[Alec Guinness]], who portrayed the elderly Obi-Wan, to make a believable younger version.{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|p=44-45}} McGregor had a vocal coach to help his voice sound closer to Guinness's. He also studied several of Guinness's performances, from his early work and the original ''Star Wars'' films.<ref name="ProductionNotes" />
* [[Natalie Portman]] as [[Padmé Amidala]], the fourteen-year-old Queen of [[Naboo]], who hopes to protect her planet from the Trade Federation's blockade invasion. Throughout most of the film, she uses her birth name Padmé Naberrie and poses as one of the queen's handmaidens for protection. Over 200 actresses auditioned for the role.<ref>{{harvnb|Bowen|2005|p=3}}</ref> The production notes stated that "The role required a young woman who could be believable as the ruler of that planet, but at the same time be vulnerable and open". Portman was chosen especially for her performances in ''[[Léon: The Professional]]'' (1994) and ''[[Beautiful Girls (film)|Beautiful Girls]]'' (1996), which impressed Lucas.<ref name="ProductionNotes">{{cite web |url=https://www.starwars.com/episode-i/bts/production/f19990501/indexp4.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041023023458/http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/bts/production/f19990501/indexp4.html |archive-date=October 23, 2004 |date=May 1, 1999 |title=Star Wars Episode I'' Production Notes: The Actors and Characters&nbsp;– Part I |publisher=StarWars.com |access-date=April 5, 2009}}</ref> He stated, "I was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the lines of [[Princess Leia|Leia]] [and] Natalie embodied all those traits and more".<ref name="ProductionNotes" /> Portman was unfamiliar with ''Star Wars'' before being cast,<ref name="ProductionNotes" /> but was enthusiastic about being cast as a character she expected to become a role model. Portman said, "It was wonderful playing a young queen with so much power. I think it will be good for young women to see a strong woman of action who is also smart and a leader."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/portman/profile.html |title=Return of the galaxy's new beauty |publisher=CNN |access-date=April 5, 2009 |year=2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423045820/http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/portman/profile.html|archive-date=April 23, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>
* [[Jake Lloyd]] as [[Darth Vader|Anakin "Ani" Skywalker]], a nine-year-old slave boy and a skilled pilot who dreams of becoming a Jedi. Hundreds of actors were tested across the UK, Ireland, Canada, and the United States<ref name="ProductionNotes" /> before the producers settled on Lloyd, who Lucas considered met his requirements of "a good actor, enthusiastic and very energetic". Producer [[Rick McCallum]] said that Lloyd was "smart, mischievous, and loves anything mechanical{{mdash}}just like Anakin."<ref name="NotesII" />
* [[Ian McDiarmid]] as [[Palpatine]], a middle aged senator of Naboo and a secret Sith Lord who orchestrates the invasion of his home planet to get elected Supreme Chancellor. He is the Trade Federation's mysterious benefactor, and the titular "Phantom Menace". McDiarmid was surprised when Lucas approached him sixteen years after ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' to reprise the role of Palpatine, having assumed that a younger actor would play the role in the prequel films.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/profile/beacon134.html |title=''Homing Beacon'' #134: Palpatine Speaks |date=April 14, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050418000540/http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/profile/beacon134.html |archive-date=April 18, 2005 |publisher=StarWars.com |access-date=April 5, 2009}}</ref>
* [[Ahmed Best]] as [[Jar Jar Binks]], a clumsy [[List of Star Wars races (F-J)#Gungan|Gungan]] exiled from his home and taken in by Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. Best was hired after casting director Robin Gurland saw him on a [[Stomp (dance troupe)|Stomp]] performance in [[San Francisco]].<ref name="NotesII" /> Best was originally intended to provide motion capture data, but his offer to voice the character was accepted. On the set, to provide references for the actors, Best was clothed in a suit made of foam and latex and a headpiece. Best's filmed performance was later replaced with the computer-generated character.<ref name="behind" /> Best frequently improvised movements to make Jar Jar look as clumsy and comedic as possible.<ref name="NotesII" />
* [[Anthony Daniels]] as [[C-3PO]], a protocol droid built by Anakin. He lacks a metal covering in this film; R2-D2 humorously refers to it as being "naked". Industrial Light & Magic's Michael Lynch, dressed in a color closely matching the background{{mdash}}in a manner similar to the Japanese puppet theater [[Bunraku]]{{mdash}} manipulated a skeletal C-3PO figure attached to his front while Daniels read his lines off-camera. The puppeteer was erased from the film during post-production.<ref name="NotesII" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.starwars.com/episode-i/bts/production/f19991102/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102150746/http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/bts/production/f19991102/index.html |title=The Man (Literally) Behind C-3PO |date=November 2, 1999 |publisher=StarWars.com |access-date=April 24, 2009 |archive-date=November 2, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
* [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]] as [[R2-D2]], an astromech droid from Naboo that saves Queen Amidala's ship when other astro droids fail. Before the film's production started, fans campaigned on the Internet to retain Baker as R2-D2; Lucas replied that the actor would reprise the role. Baker is used for scenes where R2-D2 bends forwards and backwards and wobbles from side-to-side. Robots and a digital model were used in other shots.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}
* [[Pernilla August]] as [[Shmi Skywalker]], Anakin's mother, who is concerned for her son's future and allows him to leave with the Jedi. August, a veteran of Swedish cinema, was chosen after auditioning with Liam Neeson. She was afraid of being rejected because of her accent.<ref name="behind">{{cite magazine |url=https://ew.com/ew/article/0,,273480,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619120647/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C273480%2C00.html |archive-date=June 19, 2007 |title=Behind the scenes of ''The Phantom Menace'' |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |last=Daly |first=Steven |access-date=April 5, 2009 |date=May 19, 1999 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
* [[Frank Oz]] as [[Yoda]], the centuries-old Jedi Grandmaster and head of the Jedi Council who is apprehensive about allowing Anakin to be trained. Yoda was mostly portrayed as a puppet designed by [[Nick Dudman]] based on [[Stuart Freeborn]]'s original design. Oz controlled the puppet's mouth, and other parts were controlled by puppeteers using remote controls.<ref name="behind" /> Lucas fitted Yoda's filming around Oz's schedule as he finished and promoted ''[[In & Out (film)|In & Out]]''.{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|p=96}} A computer-generated Yoda is featured in two distant shots. [[Warwick Davis]] (who played the part of the Ewok Wicket W.

== Production ==

=== Development ===
While writing the [[Star Wars (film)|original ''Star Wars'' film]],{{EpIV}} Lucas decided the story was too vast to be covered in one film. He introduced a wider story arc that could be told in sequels if it became successful.<ref>George Lucas intro to ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'' 1994 reissue</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rinzler|2007|p=107}}</ref> He negotiated a contract that allowed him to make two sequels, and over time created an elaborate [[backstory]] to aid his writing process.<ref>{{harvnb|Kaminski|2007|p=134}}</ref> While writing the second film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Lucas considered directions in which to take the story. In the original trilogy, Darth Vader was revealed to have been Anakin Skywalker, a once-powerful Jedi Knight, and a traitor to the Jedi Order.<ref>{{harvnb|Kaminski|2007|pp=164–165}}</ref> With this backstory in place, Lucas decided that the movies would work best as a trilogy.<ref>{{harvnb|Bouzereau|1997|p=123}}</ref> In the trilogy's final episode, ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', Vader is redeemed through an act of sacrifice for Luke.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953916,00.html |title=I've Got to Get My life Back Again |author1=Clarke, Gerald |author2=Worrell, Denise |date=May 23, 1983 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=April 23, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222004356/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953916,00.html|archive-date=December 22, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Throughout the 1980s, Lucas said he had no desire to return to ''Star Wars'' and had canceled his [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]] by the time of ''Return of the Jedi''. However, because Lucas had developed most of the backstory, the idea of prequels continued to fascinate him.<ref>{{harvnb|Kaminski|2007|p=227}}</ref> In the early 1990s, ''Star Wars'' saw a resurgence in popularity in the wake of [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]]'s [[List of Star Wars comic books|comic line]] and [[Timothy Zahn]]'s [[Thrawn trilogy|trilogy of novels]]. Lucas saw that there was still a large audience for his idea of a prequel trilogy, and with the development of special effects generated with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), Lucas considered returning to his saga and directing the film.<ref>{{harvnb|Kaminski|2007|pp=294–295}}</ref> In October 1993, it was announced in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and other sources that he would be making the prequels.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.deseret.com/1993/10/3/19068970/lucas-says-star-wars-prequel-is-on-its-way |title=Lucas Says Star Wars Prequel Is On Its Way |last=Hicks |first=Chris |date=October 2, 1993 |access-date=February 19, 2023 |website=DesertNews}}</ref> Lucas began outlining the story; Anakin Skywalker rather than Obi-Wan Kenobi would be the protagonist, and the series would be a tragedy examining Darth Vader's origins. A relic of the original outline was that Anakin would, like his son, grow up on Tatooine.<ref>{{harvnb|Kaminski|2008|p=318}}</ref> Lucas also began to change the prequels' timeline relative to the original series; instead of filling in the tangential history, they would form the beginning of a long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step toward turning the franchise into a saga.<ref>{{harvnb|Kaminski|2007|pp=299–300}}</ref>

Lucas began writing the ''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy on November 1, 1994. The screenplay of ''Star Wars'' was adapted from Lucas' 15-page outline that was written in 1976, which he designed to help him keep track of the characters' backstories and events that occurred before the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original trilogy]].<ref name="Idea">"Special Featurette", ''All I Need Is An Idea'' (2001), DVD</ref> Anakin was first written as a twelve-year-old, but Lucas reduced his age to nine because he felt that the lower age would better fit the plot point of Anakin being affected by his mother's separation from him. Eventually, Anakin's younger age led Lucas to rewrite his participation in the movie's major scenes.{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|p=7}} The film's working title was ''The Beginning'', with the title not being changed to ''The Phantom Menace'' until shortly before the film's completion.<ref name="Idea" /> Lucas later revealed that the ''Phantom Menace'' title was a reference to Palpatine hiding his true identity as an evil Sith Lord behind the facade of a well-intentioned public servant.<ref>{{harvnb|Bowen|2005|p=93}}</ref>

The larger budget and possibilities opened up by the use of digital effects made Lucas "think about a much grander, more epic scale{{mdash}}"which is what I wanted ''Star Wars'' to be".<ref name=vision>{{cite journal |title=Return of the Jedi |pages=15–32 |author=Shay, Don |journal=[[Cinefex]] |issue=78 |date=July 1999}}</ref> The story ended with five simultaneous, ongoing plots, one leading to another. The central plot is Palpatine's intent to become Chancellor, which leads to the Trade Federation's attack on Naboo, the Jedi being sent there, Anakin being met along the way, and the rise of the Sith Lords. As with the original trilogy, Lucas intended ''The Phantom Menace'' to illustrate several themes throughout the narrative. Duality is a frequent theme; Amidala is a queen who passes as a handmaiden, Palpatine plays on both sides of the war, among others. "Balance" is frequently suggested; Anakin is supposedly "the one" chosen to bring balance to the Force{{mdash}}Lucas said, "Anakin needed to have a mother, Obi-Wan needed a Master, Darth Sidious needed an apprentice" as without interaction and dialogue, "you wouldn't have drama".{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|pp=8–9}}

In November 2015, [[Ron Howard]] confirmed that he, [[Robert Zemeckis]], and [[Steven Spielberg]] were approached by Lucas to direct ''The Phantom Menace''. All three approached directors told Lucas that he should direct the film, as they each found the project "too daunting."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/star-wars-episode-1-ron-howard-steven-spielberg-robert-zemeckis/ |title=Star Wars Episode 1 Was Offered to Ron Howard |date=November 25, 2015 |work=Collider|access-date=December 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129003634/http://collider.com/star-wars-episode-1-ron-howard-steven-spielberg-robert-zemeckis/|archive-date=November 29, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Pre-production and design ===
Before Lucas had started writing, his producing partner [[Rick McCallum]] was preparing for the film. McCallum stated that his experience with ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' led to many of his decisions on ''The Phantom Menace'', such as long-term deals with actors and soundstages, the employment of recent graduates with no film experience, and the creation of sets and landscapes with digital technology. In April 1994, McCallum started searching for artists in art, architecture and design schools, and in mid-year he began location scouting with production designer Gavin Bocquet. [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) art director [[Doug Chiang]] impressed McCallum the most and was hired as the design director.{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|pp=10–12}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Christopher |first=James |date=April 12, 2000 |title=Greetings, Earthlings; Arts |work=The Times |page=16}}</ref> Art development on the film began in January 1995.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vaz |first1=Mark Cotta |title=The Art of Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones |date=2002 |publisher=Ballantine Publ. Group |location=New York |isbn=978-0-345-43125-7 |edition=1st |page=[https://archive.org/details/artofstarwarsepi0000vazm/page/2 2] |url=https://archive.org/details/artofstarwarsepi0000vazm/page/2 }}</ref>

Within three to four months of Lucas beginning the writing process, Chiang and his design team started a two-year process of reviewing thousands of designs for the film.<ref name="Thousands">''Thousands of Things'' DVD Special Featurette, [2001]</ref> Chiang stated that Lucas intended ''Episode I'' to be stylistically different from the other ''Star Wars'' films; it would be "richer and more like a period piece, since it was the history leading up to ''A New Hope''." The story takes place on three planets, some with varied environments such as the human and Gungan cities of Naboo and three buildings in Coruscant. With the exception of the Gungan city, which had an [[art nouveau]]-inspired visual, these locations would be given distinctive looks with some basis in the real world. The concept drawings of [[Ralph McQuarrie]] for the original trilogy served as the basis for Mos Espa{{mdash}}which was also inspired by old Tunisian hotels and buildings and had touches such as a marketplace to differentiate it from ''A New Hope''{{'}}s Mos Eisley{{mdash}}and Coruscant, in particular a metropolis design that became the basis for the Senate.{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|pp=12–17}} Bocquet would later develop the work of Chiang's team and design the interiors, translating the concepts into construction blueprints with environments and architectural styles that had some basis in reality "to give the audience something to key into."{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|pp=54–55}} Some elements were directly inspired by the original trilogy; Lucas described the battle droids as predecessors to the [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]]. Chiang uses that orientation to base the droids on the Imperial soldiers, only in the same style of stylized and elongated features seen in tribal African art.<ref name=vision />

[[Terryl Whitlatch]], who had a background on zoology and anatomy, was in charge of creature design. Many of the aliens are hybrids, combining features of real animals. At times, entire food chains were developed, even though only a small percentage of them would appear in the film. Whitlatch also designed detailed skeletons for the major characters and facial muscles on Jar Jar Binks as a reference for ILM's animators. Each creature would reflect its environment; those on Naboo were more beautiful because the planet is "lush and more animal-friendly", Tatooine has rough-looking creatures "with weather-beaten leathery skin to protect them from the harsh desert elements", and Coruscant has bipedal, human-looking aliens.{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|pp=16–22}}

The film made extensive use of the new technique of digital pre-visualization, using computers to essentially create 3-D animated storyboards. This was done for dozens of scenes in the film but was first and primarily used in the pod race sequence. Animatic supervisor David Dozoretz, also an ILM alum, worked on this sequence for nearly three years, and at one point had a 25-minute version of the race, although the film only included a 9-minute version.{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}

[[File:Duel of the Fates.jpg|right|thumb|Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi dueling Darth Maul. Lucas wanted the lightsaber battles to be fast and more intense than those of the original trilogy, depicting the Jedi in their prime. This scene was highly praised by critics and audiences.|alt=Three men fight with laser swords in an hangar.]]
[[Stunt]] coordinator [[Nick Gillard]] was recruited to create a new Jedi fighting style for the prequel trilogy. Gillard likened the lightsaber battles to a chess game "with every move being a [[check (chess)|check]]". Because of their short-range weapons, Gillard thought that the Jedi would have had to develop a fighting style that merged every sword fighting style, such as [[kendo]] and other [[kenjutsu]] styles, with other swinging techniques, such as tennis swings and tree-chopping. While training Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, Gillard wrote a sequence that lasted around 60 seconds and intended to be around five or six sequences per fight.<ref name="Prime">''Prime of the Jedi'' DVD Special Featurette, [2001]</ref> Lucas later referred to the Jedi as "negotiators" rather than high-casualty soldiers. The preference of hand-to-hand combat was intended to give a spiritual and intellectual role to the Jedi.<ref name="Prime" /> Because Gillard thought that the stunt jumps with the actors and stuntmen dangling from wires did not look realistic, [[air ram]]s were used to propel them into the air instead.<ref name=mak>{{harvnb|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|pp=102–3}}</ref>

Lucas decided to make elaborate costumes, because the film's society was more sophisticated than the one depicted in the original trilogy. Designer Trisha Biggar and her team created over 1,000 costumes that were inspired by various cultures.<ref>''Costumes'' DVD Special Featurette, [2001]</ref> Biggar worked closely with concept designer Iain McCaig to create a color palette for the inhabitants of each world: Tatooine followed ''A New Hope'' with sun-bleached sand colors, Coruscant had grays, browns, and blacks, and Naboo had green and gold for humans while Gungans wore "a leathery look, like their skin". The Jedi costumes followed the tradition from the original film;{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|p=23}} Obi-Wan's costume was inspired by the costume that was worn by Guinness. Lucas said he and Biggar would look at the conceptual art to "translat[e] all of these designs into cloth and fabric and materials that would actually work and not look silly". Biggar also consulted Gillard to ensure that the costumes would accommodate action scenes, and consulted the creature department to find which fabrics "wouldn't wear too heavily" on the alien skins. A huge wardrobe department was set up at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|Leavesden Film Studios]] to create over 250 costumes for the main actors and 5,000 for the background ones.{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|pp=60–64}}

[[List of Star Wars characters|Nute Gunray]]'s [[Thai language|Thai]] accent was chosen after Lucas and McCallum listened to various languages to decide how the Neimoidians would speak.<ref>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202050217/http://www.starwars.com/episode-ii/bts/profile/f20020530/index.html |url=https://www.starwars.com/episode-ii/bts/profile/f20020530/index.html |title=Silas Carson: Hero with a Thousand Faces |publisher=StarWars.com |archive-date=February 2, 2008 |date=May 30, 2002 |access-date=April 5, 2009}}</ref> The character design of [[Watto]] was an amalgam of rejected ideas; his expressions were based on video footage of Secombe's voice acting, photographs of animation supervisor [[Rob Coleman]] imitating the character, and modeler Steve Alpin saying Watto's lines to a mirror.<ref>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112000442/http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/bts/production/f19990617/index.html |url=https://www.starwars.com/episode-i/bts/production/f19990617/index.html |archive-date=November 12, 2007 |title=Watto's Character Development&nbsp;– From Concept to CG |date=June 17, 1999 |publisher=StarWars.com |access-date=April 5, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Lucas described [[List of Star Wars characters|Sebulba]]'s design as "a spider crossed with an [[orangutan]] crossed with a [[sloth]]",<ref name="time" /> with a [[camel]]-like face, and clothing inspired by medieval armor.<ref>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524235020/http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/sebulba/index.html |archive-date=May 24, 2011 |url=https://www.starwars.com/databank/character/sebulba/index.html |title=Sebulba at the Star Wars Databank |publisher=StarWars.com |access-date=April 24, 2009}}</ref>

Filming began on June 26, 1997, and ended on September 30 of that year, primarily taking place at [[Leavesden Film Studios]] in England.

A binder with the film's storyboards served as a reference for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed in front of a [[chroma key]] blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds, or scenes that required cinematographer [[David Tattersall]] to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor [[John Knoll]] to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tattersall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with [[Automatic identification and data capture|data capture]] models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|pp=77–79; 84–85}}

''The Phantom Menace'' was the final ''[[Star Wars]]'' film to be shot on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] until ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' (2015). Some scenes, mostly of elements filmed by the special effects team, were shot on high definition digital video tapes to test the performance of digital recordings, which Lucas and McCallum considered the next logical step because of the amount of digitizing{{mdash}}an expensive process compared to recording directly on digital media{{mdash}}for the compositing of computer-generated effects. All future films would be shot using [[Sony]] [[CineAlta]] high-definition video cameras.{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|pp=79–80; 120}}<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7HCzmWfb47sC&pg=PA71 |author=Metz, Cade |title=Hollywood Reboots |journal=[[PC Magazine]] |date=May 23, 2006 |pages=70–71|access-date=February 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504061920/http://books.google.com/books?id=7HCzmWfb47sC&pg=PA71|archive-date=May 4, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Greg Proops]] and [[Scott Capurro]] were filmed wearing makeup and blue bodysuits so their heads could be joined in a computer-generated body.

Because of the amount of visual effects produced, editing took two years; Paul Martin Smith started the process in England and focused on dialogue-heavy scenes. [[Ben Burtt]]{{mdash}}who was also the film's [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]]{{mdash}}was responsible for action sequences under Lucas' supervision. [[Non-linear editing system]]s played a large part in translating Lucas' vision; he constantly tweaked, revised, and reworked shots and scenes. The final sound mix was added in March 1999, and the following month, the film was completed after the delivery of the remaining visual effects shots.{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|pp=135–137; 149}}

=== Effects ===
{{quote box|right|quote="Writing the script was much more enjoyable this time around because I wasn't constrained by anything. You can't write one of these movies without knowing how you're going to accomplish it. With CG at my disposal, I knew I could do whatever I wanted".|&nbsp;—George Lucas{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|p=105}}| width = 27%}}
The film saw a breakthrough in computer generated effects. About 1,950 of the shots in ''The Phantom Menace'' have visual effects. The scene in which toxic gas is released on the Jedi is the only sequence with no digital alteration.<ref name="time" /> The work was so extensive that three visual effects supervisors divided the workload among themselves{{mdash}}John Knoll supervised the on-set production and the podrace and space battle sequences, [[Dennis Muren]] supervised the underwater sequence and the ground battle, and [[Scott Squires]], alongside teams assigned for [[miniature effect]]s and character animation, worked on the lightsaber effects.{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|pp=106}}

Until the film's production, many special effects in the film industry were achieved using miniature models, [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]] paintings, and on-set visual effects{{mdash}}although other films had made extensive use of CGI. Knoll previewed 3,500 [[storyboard]]s for the film; Lucas accompanied him to explain factors of the shots that would be practical and those that would be created through visual effects. Knoll later said that on hearing the explanations of the storyboards, he did not know how to accomplish what he had seen. The result was a mixture of original techniques and the newest digital techniques to make it difficult for the viewer to guess which technique was being used. Knoll and his visual effects team wrote new computer software, including [[Cloth modeling|cloth simulators]] to allow a realistic depiction of the digital characters' clothing, to create certain shots. Another goal was to create computer-generated characters that could act seamlessly with live-action actors. While filming scenes with CGI characters, Lucas would [[blocking (stage)|block]] the characters using their corresponding voice actors on-set. The voice actors were then removed and the live-action actors would perform the same scene alone. A CGI character would later be added into the shot to complete the conversation.<ref name="VE">''Visual Effects'' DVD Special Featurette, [2001]</ref> Lucas also used CGI to correct the physical presence of actors in certain scenes.<ref name="time" /> Practical models were used when their visuals helped with miniature sceneries for backgrounds, set extensions, and model vehicles that would be [[3D scanner|scanned]] to create the digital models or filmed to represent spaceships and podraces.{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|pp=115–124}}

Lucas, who had previously confronted problems with the props used to depict R2-D2, allowed ILM and the production's British special effects department to create their own versions of the robot. Nine R2-D2 models were created; one was for actor Kenny Baker to be dropped into, seven were built by ILM and featured two wheelchair motors capable of moving {{Convert|440|lb|kg}}, enabling it to run and be mostly used in stage sets, and the British studio produced a pneumatic R2-D2 that could shift from two to three legs and was mostly used in Tunisia because its motor drive system allowed it to drive over sand.<ref name="R2">''Bad Droid Karma'' DVD Special Featurette, [2001]</ref>

Lucas originally planned to create many of the aliens with computer graphics, but those that would be more cost-effectively realized with masks and [[animatronic]]s were created by Nick Dudman's creature effects team. These included the Neimoidians, background characters in Mos Espa, the Jedi Council, and the Galactic Senate. Dudman's team was told where the creatures would be required six months before principal photography begun, and they rushed the production. The Neimodian suits, which were originally intended as digital characters, were delivered one day before they would be required on set. Dudman traveled to Skywalker Ranch to see the original creatures that could be reused, and read the script for a breakdown of scenes with practical creatures, leaving only the more outlandish designs to be created using CGI.{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|pp=65–66}}

To research for the podrace vehicles, the visual effects crew visited a jet aircraft junkyard outside [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and scavenged four [[Boeing 747]] engines.<ref name=time>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990819-3,00.html |title=Ready, Set, Glow |magazine=Time |date=April 26, 1999 |author1=Corliss, Richard |author2=Booth, Cathy |access-date=April 24, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625185337/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990819-3,00.html|archive-date=June 25, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Life-sized replicas of the engines were built and sent to Tunisia to provide reference in the film. Except for Jake Lloyd inside a hydraulically controlled cockpit and a few practical podracer models, the entire podracing scene{{mdash}}which the effects crew designed to be as "out of this world" as possible{{mdash}}is computer-generated.<ref name="Episode1" />{{sfn|Bouzereau|Duncan|1999|pp=119–120}}

=== Themes ===
{{See also|Star Wars sources and analogues}}
Like previous ''Star Wars'' films, ''The Phantom Menace'' makes several references to historical events and films that George Lucas watched in his youth. The ''Star Wars'' films typically mix several concepts from different mythologies together, drawing heavily from the [[hero's journey]], an archetypical template developed by [[comparative mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]].<ref name="myth">{{cite news |date=April 26, 1999 |title=Of Myth And Men |work=[[Time Magazine|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990820,00.html |access-date=April 20, 2009 |first=Bill |last=Moyers|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430002812/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990820,00.html|archive-date=April 30, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The film also notably borrows from ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), including the podrace sequence, which mirrors the [[chariot race]] scene; additionally, the end celebration scene closely resembles a Roman parade in ''Ben-Hur''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Young |first=Bryan |title=The Cinema Behind Star Wars: Ben Hur |url=https://www.starwars.com/news/the-cinema-behind-star-wars-ben-hur |website=StarWars.com |access-date=September 20, 2019 |date=May 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920223626/https://www.starwars.com/news/the-cinema-behind-star-wars-ben-hur |archive-date=September 20, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Maul Devil.png|thumb|upright=1.4|The face of Darth Maul drew upon depictions of the devil.]]
There are many references to [[Christianity]] in the film, such as the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]], complete with red skin and horns.<ref name="myth" /> The ''Star Wars'' film cycle features a similar Christian narrative involving Anakin Skywalker; he is the "Chosen One"—the individual prophesied to bring balance to the Force—who was conceived of a [[Miraculous birth|virgin birth]]. However, unlike [[Jesus]], Anakin will eventually fall from grace and seemingly fail to fulfill his destiny (until the prophecy comes true in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'').<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hodge|first=Joel|date=April 21, 2015|title=How 'Star Wars' answers our biggest religious questions|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/21/how-star-wars-answers-our-biggest-religious-questions/|access-date=2020-06-18|newspaper=The Washington Post|archive-date=June 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200619022644/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/21/how-star-wars-answers-our-biggest-religious-questions/|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Japanese film]]s such as [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'' (1958) influenced the original ''Star Wars'' film; scholars say that ''The Phantom Menace'' was likewise influenced by Korean and Japanese culture. Film historians Geoff King and Tanya Krzywinska write, "The costume and make-up designs&nbsp;...&nbsp;favour a mixture of the gothic and the oriental over anything very futuristic. The gothic is most strongly apparent in Darth Maul's demonic horns and the red and black make-up mask that borrows from the facial designs found in depictions of Japanese demons". King and Krzywinska say that "Qui-Gon's pony tail and Obi-Wan's position of apprentice further encourage a reading in terms of the Samurai tradition". They also say "Amidala, in keeping with her status and character, has a number of highly formal outfits&nbsp;...&nbsp;to go with hair sculpted into a curve that frames make-up of a Japanese cast".<ref>{{Cite book |last1=King |first1=Geoff |first2=Tanya |last2=Krzywinska |title=Science Fiction Cinema: From Outerspace to Cyberspace |year=2000 |publisher=Wallflower Press |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/sciencefictionci00king/page/109 109] |isbn=1-903364-03-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/sciencefictionci00king/page/109 }}</ref>

The Jedi practice [[Zen]]-like meditation and [[martial arts]], as did the ancient Japanese [[Samurai]] warriors. The name "Qui-Gon" adapts the term [[qigong]], which refers to a Chinese discipline involving meditation and cultivation of the flow of the vital energy called "[[Qi|Chi" or "Qi"]] for healing, health, and combat. The words ''[[Ch'i]]'' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]), ''gi'' ([[Korean language|Korean]]), ''ki'' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]), and the Indian term "[[Prana]]" all refer to the energy that is thought to flow through all living things, from the source of all chi (or power), which is "The Way" or "The [[Tao]]" in Chinese philosophy. In [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosophy, from The Way, [[yin and yang]]—the opposing but complementary aspects of reality or nature—are born. Unlike Chinese philosophy, in which yin and yang are not moral qualities, the ancient Persian philosophy of [[Zurvanism]] taught that the dualism of dark and light forces are locked in an eternal battle while being two sides (or evolutes) of the same "Force", the force of time itself (Zurvan)—the prime mover. These elements derive primarily from [[Eastern religions|Eastern]] and Iranian religions and myths.<ref name="myth" />

As with other ''Star Wars'' films, themes about family and hope are featured prominently. In the episode "Legacy" of ''[[Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian]]'', [[Dave Filoni]] explains that the use of "[[Duel of the Fates]]" during the lightsaber duel between Darth Maul against Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi represents the fight for the fate of Anakin Skywalker. According to Filoni, Qui-Gon Jinn acts like a father figure towards Anakin because he feels he needs one after taking him from his mother, having realized that the Jedi shouldn't be opposed to love and care. In the end, Qui-Gon dies, and thus Anakin loses his father figure; Obi-Wan Kenobi ultimately becomes his master to honor Jinn's dying wish despite his initial contempt for him, and while he comes to eventually see him like a brother as shown in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'', he doesn't act like a father, which coupled with the Jedi's indifference, seals Anakin's fate.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Pearson|first=Ben|date=May 11, 2020|title=Why the Lightsaber Duel in 'The Phantom Menace' is the Most Important Moment in the Prequel Trilogy, According to Dave Filoni|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/dave-filoni-duel-of-the-fates-speech/|access-date=2021-02-05|website=[[/Film]]|archive-date=May 11, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200511230611/https://www.slashfilm.com/dave-filoni-duel-of-the-fates-speech/|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Music ==
{{Main|Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (soundtrack)}}
As with previous ''Star Wars'' films, ''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace''{{'}}s [[film score|score]] was composed and conducted by [[John Williams]]. He started composing the score in October 1998 and began recording the music with the London Voices and [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at [[Abbey Road Studios]] on February 10, 1999. Williams decided to use electronic instruments such as [[synthesizer]]s to enhance the sound and choral pieces to "capture the magical, mystical force that a regular orchestra might not have been able to provide", and create an atmosphere that was "more mysterious and mystical and less military" than those of the original trilogy.<ref name=williams>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991013020724/http://starwars.talkcity.com/starwars/trans/5-6-99.htmpl |url=http://starwars.talkcity.com/starwars/trans/5-6-99.htmpl |title=Chat with John Williams |publisher=TalkCity |archive-date=October 13, 1999 |date=May 6, 1999 |access-date=July 12, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> One of the most notable tracks is "[[Duel of the Fates]]", which uses the chorus to give a religious, temple-like feel to the epic lightsaber duel.

The film's soundtrack was released by [[Sony Classical Records]] on May 4, 1999. This album featured the score, which Williams restructured as a listening experience; it is not presented in film order and omits many notable cues from the film because of the space restriction of the compact disc.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/w102733|title=Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack] [The Ultimate Edition]|first=Joseph|last=Stevenson|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=July 12, 2009|archive-date=January 11, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230111153333/https://www.allmusic.com/album/star-wars-episode-i-the-phantom-menace-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-the-ultimate-edition--mw0000104631|url-status=live}}</ref> A two-disc "Ultimate Edition" was released on November 14, 2000.

Despite worries about the film being finished on time, two weeks before its theatrical release, Lucasfilm moved the release date from May 21 to 19, 1999.

=== Critical response ===
Following an advance screening on Saturday, May 8, 1999, several newspapers broke an agreement with Fox and published reviews of the film on Sunday, May 9. In a front-page review, the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' gave it 3½ stars calling it "pretty good" overall and "outstanding in many parts". The ''[[New York Daily News]]'' was less positive, giving it 2½ stars. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also made its review by [[Todd McCarthy]] available on the Sunday<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Reuters]]|title=Variety pans "Phantom Menace" as papers jump gun|last=Hillis|first=Scott|date=May 9, 1999|via=Yahoo!

Conversely, [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave it three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it "an astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking" and said, "Lucas tells a good story." Ebert also wrote that, "If some of the characters are less than compelling, perhaps that's inevitable" because it is the opening film in the new trilogy. He concluded his review by saying that rather than ''[[Star Trek]]'' films, filmmakers could "[g]ive me transparent underwater cities and vast hollow senatorial spheres any day".<ref>{{cite news |author=Ebert, Roger |title=Star Wars&nbsp;– Episode I: The Phantom Menace |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=May 17, 1999 |url=https://rogerebert.com/reviews/star-wars-episode-i-the-phantom-menace-1999 |access-date=June 29, 2006 |author-link=Roger Ebert|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415023933/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/star-wars-episode-i-the-phantom-menace-1999|archive-date=April 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a "B" grade and complimented Liam Neeson's performance and the action scenes.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://ew.com/article/1999/05/21/star-wars-episode-i-phantom-menace |title=Movie Review: Star Wars: Episode I{{mdash}}The Phantom Menace (1999)|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|date=May 21, 1999|access-date=March 29, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210105643/http://www.ew.com/article/1999/05/21/star-wars-episode-i-phantom-menace|archive-date=February 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In an ''Entertainment Weekly'' review for the DVD release, Marc Bernardin gave the film a "C−", calling it "haplessly plotted, horribly written, and juvenile".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://ew.com/article/2001/10/16/star-wars-episode-i-phantom-menace |author=Bernardin, Marc |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |title=Movie Review: Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (DVD) |date=October 16, 2001|access-date=June 8, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628020044/http://www.ew.com/article/2001/10/16/star-wars-episode-i-phantom-menace|archive-date=June 28, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> ReelViews' [[James Berardinelli]] wrote, "Looking at the big picture, in spite of all its flaws, ''The Phantom Menace'' is still among the best 'bang for a buck' fun that can be had in a movie theater," and said the film was a "distinct improvement" over ''Return of the Jedi''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/s/sw99.html |title=Star Wars (Episode 1): The Phantom Menace (United States, 1999) |author=Berardinelli, James |publisher=ReelViews |access-date=June 8, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190805101355/http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/s/sw99.html|archive-date=August 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
