'''''Portal''''' is a 2007 [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]]-[[platform game]] developed and published by [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]. It was released in a [[Product bundling|bundle]], ''[[The Orange Box]],'' for [[Windows]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]], and has been since ported to other systems, including [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (via [[Nvidia Shield]]), and [[Nintendo Switch]].

''Portal'' consists primarily of a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player's character and simple objects using "the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device", often referred to as the "portal gun", a device that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes. The player-character, [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], is challenged and taunted by an [[artificial intelligence]] named [[GLaDOS]] (Genetic Lifeform and [[Disk Operating System]]) to complete each puzzle in the [[Aperture Science Enrichment Center]] using the portal gun with the promise of receiving cake when all the puzzles are completed. The game's unique physics allows kinetic energy to be retained through portals, requiring creative use of portals to maneuver through the test chambers. This gameplay element is based on a similar concept from the game ''[[Narbacular Drop]]''; many of the team members from the [[DigiPen Institute of Technology]] who worked on ''Narbacular Drop'' were hired by Valve for the creation of ''Portal'', making it a [[spiritual successor]] to the game.

''Portal'' was acclaimed as one of the most original games of 2007, despite some criticism for its short duration. It received praise for its originality, unique gameplay and dark story with a humorous series of dialogue. GLaDOS, voiced by [[Ellen McLain]] in the English-language version, received acclaim for her unique characterization, and the end credits song "[[Still Alive]]", written by [[Jonathan Coulton]] for the game, was praised for its original composition and humorous twist. ''Portal'' is often cited as one of the [[greatest video games ever made]]. Excluding Steam download sales, over four million copies of the game have been sold since its release, spawning official merchandise from Valve including plush Companion Cubes, as well as fan recreations of [[Black Forest cake|the cake]] and portal gun. 

A standalone version with extra puzzles, ''Portal: Still Alive'', was also published by Valve on the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service in October 2008 exclusively for Xbox 360. A sequel, ''[[Portal 2]]'', was released in 2011, which expanded on the storyline, adding several gameplay mechanics and a cooperative multiplayer mode.

In ''Portal'', the player controls the protagonist, [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]] as she is challenged to navigate through a series of test chambers using the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or portal gun, under the watchful supervision of the artificial intelligence [[GLaDOS]]. The portal gun can create two distinct portal ends, orange and blue. The portals create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in [[three-dimensional space]]. Neither end is specifically an entrance or exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. An important aspect of the game's physics is momentum redirection and conservation.<ref name="commentary">{{Cite video game |title=Portal |developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |date=October 9, 2007 |level=In-game developer commentary}}</ref> As moving objects pass through portals, they come through the exit portal at the same direction that the exit portal is facing and with the same speed with which they passed through the entrance portal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3770/games_demystified_portal.php |title=Games Demystified: Portal |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |first=Jeremy |last=Alessi |date=August 26, 2008 |access-date=August 28, 2008 |archive-date=August 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807083401/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3770/games_demystified_portal.php |url-status=live}}</ref> For example, a common maneuver is to place a portal some distance below the player on the floor, jump down through it, gaining speed in freefall, and emerge through the other portal on a wall, flying over a gap or another obstacle. This process of gaining speed and then redirecting that speed towards another area of a puzzle allows the player to launch objects or Chell over great distances, both vertically and horizontally, referred to as 'flinging' by Valve.<ref name="commentary" /> As GLaDOS puts it, "In layman's terms: speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out." If portal ends are not on parallel planes, the character passing through is reoriented to be upright with respect to gravity after leaving a portal end.

Chell and all other objects in the game that can fit into the portal ends will pass through the portal. However, a portal shot cannot pass through an open portal; it will simply deactivate or create a new portal in an offset position. Creating a portal end instantly deactivates an existing portal end of the same color. Moving objects, glass, special wall surfaces, liquids, or areas that are too small will not be able to anchor portals. Chell is sometimes provided with cubes that she can pick up and use to climb on or to hold down large buttons that open doors or activate mechanisms. Particle fields, known as "Emancipation Grills", occasionally called "Fizzlers" in the developer commentary, exist at the end of all and within some test chambers; when passed through, they will deactivate any active portals and disintegrate any object carried through. These fields also block attempts to fire portals through them.<ref name="360 manual">{{cite book |title=The Orange Box manual (Xbox 360 version) |publisher=Valve |year=2007 |pages=12–17}}</ref>

Although Chell is equipped with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling,<ref name="commentary" /> she can be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. She can also be killed by objects hitting her at high speeds, and by a series of crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no [[Health (gaming)|health]] indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain amount of damage in a short period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.

Many solutions exist for completing each puzzle.<ref name="gamespotarticle1">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-2-episode-two-the-return-of-team-fortress-2-and-other-surprises/1100-6154006/ |title=Half-Life 2: Episode Two&nbsp;— The Return of Team Fortress 2 and Other Surprises |access-date=July 21, 2006 |author=Ocampo |date=July 13, 2006 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |first=Jason |archive-date=March 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323210156/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-2-episode-two-the-return-of-team-fortress-2-and-other-surprises/1100-6154006/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Two additional modes are unlocked upon the completion of the game that challenge the player to work out alternative methods of solving each test chamber.

==Synopsis==
<!--DO NOT ADD EXCESSIVE DETAILS TO THE PLOT. A BLOW-BY-BLOW EXPLANATION OF THE PLOT IS NOT APPROPRIATE (see [[WP:NOT#PLOT]]). DO NOT ADD SPOILER TAGS. THE SECTION TITLE "PLOT SYNOPSIS" CARRIES THE [[WP:SPOILER]] WARNING IMPLICITLY. -->

===Characters===
The game features two characters<!-- Please, do NOT change to 3 characters. The Weighted Companion Cube is NOT a character, but merely a main item used in the game. -->: the [[player character|player-controlled]] [[silent protagonist]] named [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], and [[GLaDOS]] (Genetic Lifeform and [[Disk Operating System]]), a computer [[artificial intelligence]] that monitors and directs the player. In the English-language version, GLaDOS is voiced by [[Ellen McLain]], though her voice has been altered to sound more artificial. The only background information presented about Chell is given by GLaDOS; the credibility of these facts, such as Chell being adopted, an orphan, and having no friends, is questionable at best, as GLaDOS is a liar by her own admission. In the "Lab Rat" comic created by Valve to bridge the gap between ''Portal'' and ''[[Portal 2]]'', Chell's records reveal she was ultimately rejected as a test subject for having "too much tenacity"—the main reason Doug Rattman, a former employee of Aperture Science, moved Chell to the top of the test queue.<ref name="labrat part 1" /><ref name="labrat part 2" />

===Setting===
{{anchor|Aperture Science}}
[[File:Aperture Laboratories Logo.svg|thumb|The logo for Aperture Science Laboratories]]
''Portal'' takes place in the [[Aperture Science Laboratories|Aperture Science Laboratories Computer-Aided Enrichment Center]], a research facility responsible for the creation of the portal gun. Information about Aperture Science, developed by Valve for creating the setting of the game, is revealed during the game and via the real-world promotional website.<ref name="gi apsci history">{{cite magazine |url=http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/24/Aperture-Science_3A00_-A-History.aspx |title=Aperture Science: A History |first=Meagan |last=VanBurkleo |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |date=March 24, 2010 |access-date=March 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327072045/http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/24/Aperture-Science_3A00_-A-History.aspx |archive-date=March 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> According to the Aperture Science website, [[Cave Johnson (Portal)|Cave Johnson]] founded the company in 1943 for the sole purpose of making [[shower curtain]]s for the U.S. military. However, after becoming mentally unstable from "moon rock poisoning" in 1978, Johnson created a three-tier [[research and development]] plan to make his organization successful. The first two tiers, the [[Abdominal thrusts|Counter-Heimlich Maneuver]] (a maneuver designed to ensure choking) and the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation|Take-A-Wish Foundation]] (a program to give the wishes of terminally ill children to adults in need of dreams), were commercial failures and led to an investigation of the company by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. However, when the investigative committee heard of the success of the third tier—a person-sized, ad hoc quantum tunnel through physical space, with a possible application as a shower curtain—it recessed permanently and gave Aperture Science an open-ended contract to continue its research. The development of GLaDOS, an artificially intelligent research assistant and disk-operating system, began in 1986 in response to [[Black Mesa Research Facility|Black Mesa]]'s work on similar portal technology.<ref name="aperture">{{cite web |url=http://www.aperturescience.com |title=Aperture Science Web Site (login: cjohnson password: tier3) |publisher=Valve |access-date=November 22, 2009 |archive-date=September 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917065753/http://www.aperturescience.com/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

A presentation seen during gameplay reveals that GLaDOS was also included in a proposed bid for de-icing fuel lines, incorporated as a fully functional disk-operation system that is arguably alive, unlike Black Mesa's proposal, which inhibits ice, nothing more.<ref name="gi portal hl">{{cite magazine |url=http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/10/opening-the-portal-exploring-portal-s-creation-and-its-ties-to-half-life-2.aspx |title=Exploring Portal's Creation And Its Ties To Half-Life 2 |first=Ben |last=Reeves |date=March 10, 2010 |access-date=March 10, 2010 |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |archive-date=March 14, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314141455/http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/10/opening-the-portal-exploring-portal-s-creation-and-its-ties-to-half-life-2.aspx |url-status=live}}</ref> Roughly thirteen years later, work on GLaDOS was completed and the untested AI was activated during the company's [[Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day|bring-your-daughter-to-work day]] in May 2000.<ref name="gi apsci history" /> Immediately after activation, the facility was flooded with deadly neurotoxin by the AI. Events of the first ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' game occur shortly after that, presumably leaving the facility forgotten by the outside world due to apocalyptic happenings. Wolpaw, in describing the ending of ''Portal 2'', affirmed that the [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] invasion, chronologically taking place after ''Half-Life'' and before ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', had occurred before ''Portal 2''{{'}}s events.<ref name="pcgamer p2 wolpaw interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/04/26/erik-wolpaw-on-portal-2s-ending-the-spoiler-is-probably-lurking-out-there-somewhere/ |title=Erik Wolpaw on Portal 2's ending: "the [spoiler] is probably lurking out there somewhere" |first=Rich |last=Stanton |date=April 26, 2011 |access-date=April 26, 2011 |work=[[PC Gamer]] |archive-date=April 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430071821/http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/04/26/erik-wolpaw-on-portal-2s-ending-the-spoiler-is-probably-lurking-out-there-somewhere |url-status=live}}</ref>

The areas of the Enrichment Center that Chell explores suggest that it is part of a massive research installation.

===Plot===
The game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions from [[GLaDOS]], an [[artificial intelligence]], about upcoming tests. Chell enters into sequential distinct chambers that introduce her to varying challenges to solve using her portal gun, with GLaDOS as her only interaction.<ref name="commentary" /> GLaDOS promises cake as a reward for Chell if she completes all the test chambers.<ref name="gamespy pc review">{{cite web |url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/portal/826434p1.html |title=Portal (PC) |first=Sal |last=Accardo |date=October 9, 2007 |access-date=February 25, 2008 |publisher=GameSpy |archive-date=January 5, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105104204/http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/portal/826434p1.html |url-status=live}}</ref> As Chell nears completion, GLaDOS's motives and behavior turn more sinister, suggesting insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, including a live-fire course designed for military androids, as well as chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid. In one chamber, GLaDOS forces Chell to "[[Euthanasia|euthanize]]" a [[Weighted Companion Cube]] in an [[incinerator]], after Chell uses it for assistance.<ref name="1up pc review" /><ref name="eurogamer pc review">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=85005 |title=Portal |first=Tom |last=Bradwell |date=October 10, 2007 |access-date=February 25, 2008 |publisher=Eurogamer |archive-date=August 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810042422/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/portal-review |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="ign pc review">{{cite web |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/825/825987p1.html |title=Portal Review |first=Dan |last=Adams |date=October 9, 2007 |access-date=February 25, 2008 |publisher=IGN |archive-date=March 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310153712/http://pc.ign.com/articles/825/825987p1.html |url-status=dead}}</ref>

After Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS manoeuvres Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her. Chell escapes with the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center.<ref name="wellplayed">{{cite book |title=Well Played 1.0: Video Game, Value and Meaning |isbn=978-0-557-06975-0 |editor=Drew Davidson |year=2009 |first=Nick |last=Montfort |chapter=Portal of Ivory, Passage of Horn |publisher=ETC Press |chapter-url=http://www.etc.cmu.edu/etcpress/content/portal-passage-nick-montfort |display-editors=etal |access-date=January 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108061935/http://www.etc.cmu.edu/etcpress/content/portal-passage-nick-montfort# |archive-date=January 8, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> GLaDOS panics and insists that she was pretending to kill Chell as part of testing, while it becomes clear that GLaDOS had previously killed all the inhabitants of the center.<ref name="labrat part 1" /><ref name="labrat part 2" /> Chell travels further through the maintenance areas, discovering dilapidated backstage areas covered in graffiti that includes statements such as "[[the cake is a lie]]", and [[pastiche]]s of quotes from famous poets such as [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] and [[Emily Brontë]].<ref name="commentary" />

Despite GLaDOS's attempts to dissuade her with lies and threats, Chell proceeds and eventually confronts GLaDOS in a large chamber where her hardware hangs overhead. A sphere soon falls from GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that the sphere was the morality core of her conscience, one of multiple personality cores that Aperture Science employees installed after she flooded the center with neurotoxin gas; with the core removed, she can access its emitters again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS mocks and attacks her. After Chell destroys the last personality core, a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell lies outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS, but is promptly dragged away by an unseen robotic entity.{{efn|The game's original ending does not include the entity taking Chell, and was [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively]] included following the announcement of ''[[Portal 2]]''.<ref name="gi portal hl" /><ref name="shacknews update 2" />}}

=== Story ===
For the first year of development, the team focused mostly on the gameplay without narrative structure. [[Playtest|Playtesters]] found the game fun but asked about what these test chambers were leading towards. This prompted the team to come up with a narrative for ''Portal''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-reflects-on-the-orange-box-ten-years-later/ |title=Valve reflects on The Orange Box, ten years later |first=Samuel |last=Roberts |date=October 10, 2017 |access-date=October 10, 2017 |work=[[PC Gamer]] |archive-date=October 10, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010144020/http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-reflects-on-the-orange-box-ten-years-later/ |url-status=live}}</ref> 

The team worked with [[Marc Laidlaw]], the writer of the Valve's ''Half-Life'' series, to fit ''Portal'' into the ''Half-Life'' universe.<ref name="1upinterview">{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=0&cId=3153489 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213231/http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=0&cId=3153489 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |title=Portal Preview |access-date=September 11, 2006 |author=Leone |date=September 8, 2006 |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |first=Matt}}</ref> This was done, in part, due to the limited art capabilities of the small team; instead of creating new assets for ''Portal'', they reused the ''Half-Life 2'' art assets.<ref name="gi portal hl" /> Laidlaw opposed the crossover, feeling "made both universes smaller", and said later: "I just had to react as gracefully as I could to the fact that it was going there without me. It didn't make any sense except from a resource-restricted point of view."<ref name=":02">{{Cite news |last=Peel |first=Jeremy |date=March 1, 2023 |title='The narrative had to be baked into the corridors': Marc Laidlaw on writing ''Half-Life'' |language=en |work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-narrative-had-to-be-baked-into-the-corridors-marc-laidlaw-on-writing-half-life |access-date=March 3, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230302232014/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-narrative-had-to-be-baked-into-the-corridors-marc-laidlaw-on-writing-half-life |archive-date=March 2, 2023}}</ref>

Valve hired [[Erik Wolpaw]] and [[Chet Faliszek]] to write ''Portal.'' Wolpaw felt that the constraints improved the game.<ref>{{cite web |last=Irwin |first=Mary Jane |date=February 23, 2008 |title=GDC: A Portal Postmortem |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/gdc-portal-postmortem |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120905022731/http://www.next-gen.biz/news/gdc-portal-postmortem |archive-date=September 5, 2012 |access-date=February 26, 2008 |publisher=Next-Gen Biz}}</ref> The concept of a computer AI guiding the player through experimental facilities to test the portal gun was arrived at early in the writing process.<ref name="gi portal hl" /> They drafted early lines for the yet-named "polite" AI with humorous situations, such as requesting the player's character to "assume the party escort submission position", and found this style of approach to be well-suited to the game they wanted to create, leading to the creation of the GLaDOS character.<ref name="gi portal hl" /> GLaDOS was central to the plot. Wolpaw said: "We designed the game to have a very clear beginning, middle, and end, and we wanted GLaDOS to go through a personality shift at each of these points."<ref name="rbs wolpaw interview" /> 

Wolpaw described the idea of using cake as the reward came about as "at the beginning of the ''Portal'' development process, we sat down as a group to decide what philosopher or school of philosophy our game would be based on. That was followed by about 15 minutes of silence and then someone mentioned that a lot of people like cake."<ref name="gi portal hl" /><ref name="rbs wolpaw interview">{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-interview-valves-erik-wolpaw |title=RPS Interview: Valve's Erik Wolpaw |website=[[Rock Paper Shotgun]] |date=October 31, 2007 |access-date=October 31, 2007 |first=John |last=Walker |archive-date=February 28, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210228162946/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-interview-valves-erik-wolpaw |url-status=live }}</ref> The cake element, along with additional messages given to the player in the behind-the-scenes areas, were written and drawn by [[Kim Swift]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolpinchefsky/2012/06/26/kim-swift-creator-of-portal-discusses-her-latest-game-quantum-conundrum/ |title=Kim Swift, Creator of 'Portal,' Discusses Her Latest Game, 'Quantum Conundrum' |first=Carol |last=Pinchefsky |date=June 26, 2012 |access-date=June 26, 2012 |work=[[Forbes]] |archive-date=June 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629014837/http://www.forbes.com/sites/carolpinchefsky/2012/06/26/kim-swift-creator-of-portal-discusses-her-latest-game-quantum-conundrum/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Design===
[[File:Portalgame.jpg|thumb|A typical ''Portal'' test chamber, with both of the player's colored portals opened, and the Weighted Companion Cube present. The clean, spartan look of the chambers was influenced by the film ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]''.]]
The austere settings in the game came about because testers spent too much time trying to complete the puzzles using decorative but non-functional elements. As a result, the setting was minimized to make the usable aspects of the puzzle easier to spot, using the clinical feel of the setting in the film ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]'' as reference.<ref name="1up beyond the box" /> While there were plans for a third area, an office space, to be included after the test chambers and the maintenance areas, the team ran out of time to include it.<ref name="1up beyond the box" /> They also dropped the introduction of the Rat Man, a character who left the messages in the maintenance areas, to avoid creating too much narrative for the game,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/359961/portal-devs-reveal-the-glados-that-never-was-inspiration-behind-weighted-companion-cube |title=Portal Devs Reveal the GLaDOS That Never Was, Inspiration Behind Weighted Companion Cube |publisher=Kotaku |date=February 23, 2008 |access-date=February 26, 2008 |first=Michael |last=McWhertor |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226135732/http://kotaku.com/359961/portal-devs-reveal-the-glados-that-never-was-inspiration-behind-weighted-companion-cube |archive-date=February 26, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> though the character was developed further in a tie-in comic "Lab Rat", that ties ''Portal'' and ''Portal 2''{{'}}s story together.<ref name="labrat part 1">{{cite web |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/116/1160605p1.html |title=Portal 2: Lab Rat – Part 1 |first=Joey |last=Esposito |date=April 8, 2011 |access-date=April 11, 2011 |publisher=IGN |archive-date=April 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410020811/http://comics.ign.com/articles/116/1160605p1.html |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="labrat part 2">{{cite web |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/116/1161043p1.html |title=Read Portal 2: Lab Rat – Part 2 |publisher=IGN |first=Joey |last=Esposito |date=April 11, 2011 |access-date=April 11, 2011 |archive-date=April 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413161812/http://comics.ign.com/articles/116/1161043p1.html |url-status=live}}</ref> According to project lead Kim Swift, the final battle with GLaDOS went through many iterations, including having the player chased by [[Goldfinger (film)|James Bond lasers]], which was partially applied to the turrets, [[Mortal Kombat|Portal Kombat]] where the player would have needed to redirect rockets while avoiding turret fire, and a chase sequence following a fleeing GLaDOS. Eventually, they found that playtesters enjoyed a rather simple puzzle with a countdown timer near the end; Swift noted, "Time pressure makes people think something is a lot more complicated than it really is", and Wolpaw admitted, "It was really cheap to make [the neurotoxin gas]" in order to simplify the dialogue during the battle.<ref name="shacknews gdc08 interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=784 |title=GDC 08: Portal Creators on Writing, Multiplayer, Government Interrogation Techniques |publisher=Shacknews |date=February 23, 2008 |access-date=February 23, 2008 |first=Chris |last=Faylor |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814204025/http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=784 |archive-date=August 14, 2009}}</ref>

Erik Wolpaw noted, "When we were still fishing around for the turret voice, Ellen did a sultry version. It didn't work for the turrets, but we liked it a lot, and so a slightly modified version of that became the model for GLaDOS's final incarnation."<ref name="rbs wolpaw interview" />

The Weighted Companion Cube inspiration was from project lead Kim Swift with additional input from Wolpaw from reading some "declassified government interrogation thing" whereby "isolation leads subjects to begin to attach to inanimate objects";<ref name="shacknews gdc08 interview" /><ref name="rbs wolpaw interview" /> Swift commented, "We had a long level called Box Marathon; we wanted players to bring this box with them from the beginning to the end. But people would forget about the box, so we added dialogue, applied the heart to the cube, and continued to up the ante until people became attached to the box. Later on, we added the incineration idea. The artistic expression grew from the gameplay."<ref name="1up beyond the box">{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3165930 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121206010935/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3165930 |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 6, 2012 |title=Beyond the Box: Orange Box Afterthoughts |publisher=1UP |date=February 6, 2008 |access-date=February 14, 2008 |first=Shawn |last=Elliot}}</ref> Wolpaw further noted that the need to incinerate the Weighted Companion Cube came as a result of the final boss battle design; they recognized they had not introduced the idea of incineration necessary to complete the boss battle, and by training the player to do it with the Weighted Companion Cube, found the narrative "way stronger" with its "death".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4151/valves_writers_and_the_creative_.php?page=1 |title=Valve's Writers And The Creative Process |date=November 2, 2009 |access-date=November 2, 2009 |first=Kris |last=Graff |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |archive-date=November 5, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105201542/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4151/valves_writers_and_the_creative_.php?page=1 |url-status=live}}</ref> Swift noted that any similarities to psychological situations in the [[Milgram experiment]] or ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' are entirely coincidental.<ref name="1up beyond the box" />

The portal gun's full name, Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, can be abbreviated as ASHPD, which resembles a shortening of the name Adrian Shephard, the protagonist of ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force]]''. Fans noticed this similarity before the game's release; as a result, the team placed a [[Red herring (plot device)|red herring]] in the game by having the letters of Adrian Shephard highlighted on keyboards found within the game.<ref name="1up beyond the box" /> According to Kim Swift, the cake is a Black Forest cake that she thought looked the best at the nearby Regent Bakery and Café in [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]], Washington, and, as an Easter egg within the game, its recipe is scattered among various screens showing lines of binary code.<ref name="german chocolate" /><ref name="gi portal cake">{{cite magazine |url=http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/31/Let-There-Be-Cake.aspx |title=Let There Be Cake |first=Meagan |last=VanBurkleo |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |date=March 31, 2010 |access-date=March 31, 2010 |archive-date=April 2, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402191959/http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/31/Let-There-Be-Cake.aspx |url-status=live}}</ref> The Regent Bakery has stated that since the release of the game, its Black Forest cake has been one of its more popular items.<ref name="gi portal cake" />

===Soundtrack===
Most of the soundtrack is non-lyrical [[ambient music]] composed by [[Kelly Bailey (composer)|Kelly Bailey]] and [[Mike Morasky]], somewhat dark and mysterious to match the mood of the environments. The closing credits song, "[[Still Alive]]", was written by [[Jonathan Coulton]] and sung by Ellen McLain (a classically-trained [[opera]]tic [[soprano]]) as the GLaDOS character. A brief instrumental version of "Still Alive" is played in an uptempo Latin style over radios in-game. Wolpaw notes that Coulton was invited to Valve a year before the release of ''Portal'', though it was not yet clear where Coulton would contribute. "Once Kim [Swift] and I met with him, it quickly became apparent that he had the perfect sensibility to write a song for GLaDOS."<ref name="portal the skinny">{{cite web |url=http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2007/10/15/portal-the-skinny/ |title=Portal: The Skinny |first=Jonathan |last=Coulton |publisher=Jonathan Coulton's blog |date=October 15, 2007 |access-date=November 1, 2007 |archive-date=August 30, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150830091747/http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2007/10/15/portal-the-skinny/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="rbs wolpaw interview" /> The use of the song over the closing credits was based on a similar concept from the game ''[[God Hand]]'', one of Wolpaw's favorite titles.<ref name="gi pax12">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2012/09/01/chell-almost-married-a-turret-in-portal-2.aspx |title=Chell Almost Married A Turret In Portal 2 |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |first=Tim |last=Turi |date=September 1, 2012 |access-date=September 6, 2012 |archive-date=September 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905034907/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2012/09/01/chell-almost-married-a-turret-in-portal-2.aspx |url-status=live}}</ref> The song was released as a free downloadable song for the [[music video game]] ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]'' on April 1, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockband.com/rockers_blog_entry/hmxsean/216671?redir=1 |title=Valve Party at GDC + Special Preview of an Upcoming DLC Song |first=Sean |last=Baptiste |publisher=Harmonix |date=February 21, 2008 |access-date=February 21, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225131915/http://www.rockband.com/rockers_blog_entry/hmxsean/216671?redir=1 |archive-date=February 25, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Still Alive">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockband.com/forums/showthread.php?t=40092 |title=DLC April 1st!
