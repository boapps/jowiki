Confronted with growing demand in the 1920s, Pomona's fourth president, [[James A. Blaisdell]], considered whether to grow the college into a large [[university]] that could acquire additional resources or remain a small institution capable of providing a more intimate educational experience. Seeking both, he pursued an alternative path inspired by the [[collegiate university]] model he observed at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], envisioning a group of independent colleges sharing centralized resources such as a library.{{sfn|Lyon|1977|loc=chpt. 14}}<ref name="DB Blaisdell">{{cite news |last=Blackstock |first=Joe |date=October 8, 2012 |title=Blaisdell's goal was to make sure the Claremont Colleges would expand, but remain small |language=en |work=[[Inland Valley Daily Bulletin]] |url=https://www.dailybulletin.com/2012/10/08/blaisdells-goal-was-to-make-sure-the-claremont-colleges-would-expand-but-remain-small/ |url-status=live |access-date=July 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709182611/https://www.dailybulletin.com/2012/10/08/blaisdells-goal-was-to-make-sure-the-claremont-colleges-would-expand-but-remain-small/ |archive-date=July 9, 2021}}</ref> On October 14, 1925, Pomona's 38th anniversary, the college founded the [[Claremont Colleges]] consortium.{{sfn|Lyon|1977|p=239}}<ref name="Brief">{{cite web |date=March 19, 2015 |title=A Brief History of Pomona College |url=https://www.pomona.edu/about/brief-history-pomona-college |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715235606/https://www.pomona.edu/about/brief-history-pomona-college |archive-date=July 15, 2018 |access-date=October 26, 2017 |publisher=Pomona College |language=en}}</ref> Construction of the Clark dormitories on North Campus (then the men's campus) began in 1929, a reflection of president [[Charles Edmunds]]' prioritization of the college's residential life.{{sfn|Lyon|1977|loc=chpt. 16}}<ref name="1928 timeline">{{cite web |title=1928 |url=https://www.pomona.edu/timeline/1920s/1928 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210215050404/https://www.pomona.edu/timeline/1920s/1928 |archive-date=February 15, 2021 |access-date=August 12, 2020 |website=Pomona College Timeline |publisher=Pomona College |language=en}}</ref><ref name="1929 timeline">{{cite web |title=1929 |url=https://www.pomona.edu/timeline/1920s/1929 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210130074313/https://www.pomona.edu/timeline/1920s/1929 |archive-date=January 30, 2021 |access-date=August 12, 2020 |website=Pomona College Timeline |publisher=Pomona College |language=en}}</ref> Edmunds, who had previously served as president of [[Lingnan University (Guangzhou)|Lingnan University]] in [[Guangzhou]], China, inspired a growing interest in Asian culture at the college and established its [[Asian studies]] program.{{sfn|Lyon|1977|pp=312–314}}<ref name="1928 timeline" />
