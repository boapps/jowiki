The twelfth series of the [[British television|British]] [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] programme ''[[Doctor Who]]'' premiered on 1 January 2020 and aired until 1 March 2020. It is the second series to be led by [[Chris Chibnall]] as head writer and executive producer, alongside executive producer Matt Strevens, the twelfth to air after the programme's revival in 2005, and the thirty-eighth season overall. The twelfth series was broadcast on Sundays, except for the premiere episode, continuing the trend from the [[Doctor Who (series 11)|eleventh series]]. Prior to the eleventh series, regular episodes of the revived era were commonly broadcast on Saturdays. The series was followed by the 2021 New Year's Day special, "[[Revolution of the Daleks]]".

[[Jodie Whittaker]] returns for her second series as the [[Thirteenth Doctor]], an incarnation of [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], an alien [[Time Lord]] who travels through time and space in her [[TARDIS]], which appears from the outside to be an old fashioned British [[police box]]. It also stars [[Bradley Walsh]], [[Tosin Cole]] and [[Mandip Gill]] as the Doctor's travelling [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]], playing [[Graham O'Brien]], [[Ryan Sinclair]] and [[Yasmin Khan (Doctor Who)|Yasmin Khan]], respectively. The series follows the Thirteenth Doctor and her companions as they meet a new incarnation of the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]], and his destruction of [[Gallifrey]], the return of [[Jack Harkness]], the appearance of an unknown incarnation of the Doctor, the [[Cybermen]], and the secret of the "Timeless Child".

The ten episodes were directed by [[Jamie Magnus Stone]], Lee Haven Jones, [[Nida Manzoor]] and Emma Sullivan. Alongside Chibnall, who wrote four of the scripts and co-wrote a further three, the writers include [[Ed Hime]], [[Pete McTighe]] and [[Vinay Patel]], who return from writing the previous series, as well as new contributors [[Nina Metivier]], [[Maxine Alderton]] and [[Charlene James]]. Filming commenced in January 2019 and had concluded by November 2019.

An alien Kasaavin kills C, but the Doctor and her companions escape. Yaz and Ryan investigate Barton, who invites them to his birthday party. Graham and the Doctor find O in the [[Outback|Australian outback]]. Both groups encounter the Kasaavin, though the Doctor is able to capture one of them, discovering their hostile intentions. While sneaking into Barton's headquarters with Ryan, Yaz is captured by a Kasaavin, and the Doctor's captured Kasaavin frees itself by replacing itself with Yaz. Joined by O, the four investigate Barton at his party. After the Doctor reveals him, Barton tries to escape, so the Doctor and her companions pursue on motorbikes to Barton's private jet.

Seemingly peaceful at first, the facility is quickly overrun by Dregs, humanoid monsters, due to an intentional disruption of the security systems. Several guests and facility workers are killed before the Doctor re-establishes the security fields. The survivors leave the dome to save a fellow survivor, but the Dregs lead them into a trap, and they retreat to a tunnel to return to the facility. One of the guests, Bella, reveals she purposely disrupted the security field as revenge against her mother Kane, who built Tranquility Spa and ignored her childhood. The Doctor discovers the orphan planet is really Earth after years of climate change and war, and the Dregs are mutated human survivors. Kane and Bella sacrifice themselves to destroy the facility and protect the others as the Doctor safely transports them to their original planets.

Aided by ex-police officer Jake, blogger Gabriela, and medical researcher Suki, they find Jake's husband Adam in the early stages of infection, and take him to Suki's lab to evaluate him while Yaz and Gabriela explore the site where they found Jake, eventually finding a teleport to an alien location. The Doctor determines the bacterium is drawn to [[microplastics]]. Suki reveals she is from an alien race devastated by this bacterium, which they called Praxeus, and had come to Earth to evaluate it further for a cure. While the Doctor finds a cure for humans, using it on the willing Adam to test it, it cannot stop Praxeus from affecting Suki and soon disintegrates her. Travelling to Yaz's location, they find they are under the [[Indian Ocean garbage patch]], where Suki's ship is located. They load the ship's reserves with the antidote and set the ship to self-destruct in the atmosphere to disperse it, but Jake willingly pilots the vessel when the auto-pilot fails. The Doctor materialises the [[TARDIS]] around Jake, saving him moments before the explosion. With Praxeus stopped, the Doctor suggests Jake, Adam, and Gabriela travel the world together.

A spectral figure appears and reveals itself as a [[Cyberman]] named Ashad seeking the missing Cyberium, the collected knowledge of the Cybermen. The Doctor discovers Percy, finding he had found the Cyberium earlier and had gone crazy from it, with the Cyberium creating haunted imagery to prevent discovery. Despite knowing of Jack's previous warning of the lone Cyberman, the Doctor extracts the Cyberium from Percy and, under threat, gives it to Ashad, who returns to the future. The Doctor and her companions pursue, while Mary was inspired by Ashad, "this modern Prometheus," to write a story.

The Doctor has Graham and Yaz take the others in their ship to safety while she, Ryan and Ethan, one of the survivors, travel to Ko Sharmus, known as humanity's last hope. They discover Ko Sharmus is a person acting as a ferryman for other humans to escape through a portal to the other side of the universe for safety. Aboard the humans' ship, they pass through a battlefield with debris of dead Cybermen and board a seemingly-abandoned Cyber carrier. However, too late they discover that Ashad and a group of Cyberwarriors have arrived, and have since seized the control deck and directed the ship towards the Doctor, and are waking the other Cybermen in stasis. Yaz contacts the Doctor about their impending arrival, just as Ko Sharmus opens the portal. The portal is revealed to be the new location of the ruins of Gallifrey, much to the Doctor's surprise. The Master jumps through and tells the Doctor that she should be afraid because everything is about to change forever.

While in the Matrix, the Master reveals that the Doctor was an orphaned female child from another dimension founded and experimented on by a Shobogan woman named Tecteun. After many years, Tecteun eventually discovers how the Child can regenerate thus leading to the creation of the Time Lords. Meanwhile, the Master contacts Ashad to lead the Cybermen to Gallifrey but realises that he cannot have the Cyberium if Ashad is alive, prompting him to shrink Ashad and absorb the Cyberium. He then uses the Cyberium to convert the dead Time Lords into Cybermen, which he dubbed the "CyberMasters". Yaz and Graham safely reunite with Ryan and the others then follow the Cybermen to Gallifrey. Ruth helps the Doctor escape the Matrix by transmitting her old and new memories. Back in the chamber, the Doctor plans to detonate the death particle from Ashad's remains to stop the Master, but Ko Sharmus arrives and takes her place as his penance so the Doctor can escape, detonating the particle in his final moments. Before it detonated, the Master ordered the CyberMasters to follow him elsewhere. The companions return to Earth in a house disguised TARDIS and the Doctor makes her way back to her own TARDIS. Suddenly, the Judoon appear to arrest the Doctor and take her to a distant prison elsewhere in space.
