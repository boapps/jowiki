'''Morpeth''' is a historic [[market town]] in [[Northumberland]], [[North East England]], lying on the [[River Wansbeck]]. Nearby towns include [[Ashington, Northumberland|Ashington]] and [[Bedlington, Northumberland|Bedlington]]. In the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]], the population of Morpeth was given as 14,017,<ref name=2011census/> up from 13,833 in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]].<ref>{{NOMIS2001|id=1543510106|title=Morpeth Parish|access-date=9 November 2018}}</ref> The earliest evidence of settlement is believed to be from the [[Neolithic]] period, and some Roman artifacts have also been found. The first written mention of the town is from 1080, when the de Merlay family was granted the barony of Morpeth. The meaning of the town's name is uncertain, but it may refer to its position on the road to Scotland and a murder which occurred on that road. The de Merlay family built two castles in the town in the late 11th century and the 13th century. The town was granted its coat of arms in 1552. By the mid-1700s it had become one of the main markets in England, having been granted a market charter in 1200,<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> but the opening of the railways in the 1800s led the market to decline. The town's history is celebrated in the annual [[Northumbrian Gathering]].

Morpeth is governed by [[Northumberland County Council]] and Morpeth Town Council. The town is split into three wards – North, Kirkhill and Stobhill – for the purposes of parish elections. In 2008 the town suffered a severe flood, which was repeated in 2012, resulting in the construction of new flood defences. [[Morpeth railway station]] is on the east coast line and a curve to the south of it has caused [[Rail accidents at Morpeth|several rail crashes]]. Several sports teams compete in Morpeth, with [[Morpeth Town A.F.C.]] having been the winner of the [[FA Vase]] in 2016. The town hosted its own Olympics from 1873 to 1958. Two middle schools, a [[The King Edward VI School, Morpeth|high school]] and seven first schools are situated in Morpeth, as well as several churches of Anglican, Roman Catholic, United Reformed and Methodist denominations. Morpeth's [[Carlisle Park, Morpeth|Carlisle Park]], the recipient of several awards, contains one of the four [[floral clock]]s in England.

In 1540, Morpeth was described by the royal [[antiquary]] [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] as "long and metely well-builded, with low houses" and "a far fairer town than [[Alnwick]]". During the 1543–51 war of the [[Rough Wooing]], Morpeth was occupied by a garrison of Italian mercenaries, who "pestered such a little street standing in the highway" by killing deer and withholding payment for food.<ref>{{cite book |title=12th Report & Appendix, Duke of Rutland |volume=1 |date=1888 |publisher=Historical Manuscripts Commission |pages=44–45}}</ref> In 1552, William Hervey, [[Norroy and Ulster King of Arms|Norroy King of Arms]], granted the borough of Morpeth a [[coat of arms]]. The arms were the same as those granted to Roger de Merlay, but with the addition of a gold tower. In the [[letters patent]], Hervey noted that he had included the arms of the "noble and valyaunt knyght ... for a p'petuall memory of his good will and benevolence towardes the said towne".<ref>{{cite book |first=A.

Morpeth was a [[borough]] [[Time immemorial|by prescription]], but received its first charter of confirmation from [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. The corporation it created was controlled by seven companies: the Merchant Tailors, the Tanners, the Fullers and Dyers, the Smiths, the Cordwainers, the Weavers and the Butchers.<ref name="lewis"/> This remained the governing charter until the borough was reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F2T5aMzyhvwC&q=borough+reforms+morpeth+1835+charter&pg=PA449 |title=The Parliamentary Gazetteer of England and Wales |publisher=A.

== Governance ==
Morpeth has two tiers of local government.

The lower tier is Morpeth Town Council, which has 15 members. Morpeth is a [[civil parish]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.northumberland.gov.uk/NorthumberlandCountyCouncil/media/Northumberland-Knowledge/NK%20place/Parishes%20and%20towns/NlandParishMap.pdf |title=Northumberland Parish Map (Morpeth is 113) |website=Northumberland County Council}}</ref> with the status of a town.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.northumberland.gov.uk/Northumberland-Knowledge-and-JSNA/Our-Community-and-Place/Area-profiles-and-Census-Fact-Sheets.aspx |title=Statistical Profiles and Census Fact Sheets: Northumberland Towns |website=Northumberland County Council}}</ref> For the purposes of parish elections the town is divided into three [[ward (politics)|wards]]: North, Kirkhill and Stobhill, each returning five town councillors. Each ward also elects one County Councillor. In May 2021, the political make up of the Town Council was ten Conservatives, two Liberal Democrats, two Green and one Labour member.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.morpeth-tc.gov.uk/councillors/ |title=Councillors |publisher=Morpeth Town Council |access-date=12 October 2018}}:

The Morpeth Northern Bypass was a project to decrease traffic congestion in Morpeth town centre and decrease journey times from [[Pegswood]], [[Ashington]] and [[Newbiggin-by-the-Sea|Newbiggin]] to the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] and beyond. The Bypass follows on from the [[Pegswood]] Bypass at Whorral Bank Roundabout and continues to the St George's Roundabout and then onto Northgate Roundabout and St Leonard's A1 Junction. The Project was completed in 2017, which has allowed increased connectivity to SE Northumberland and beyond.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 2017 |title=Morpeth North Bypass |url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/new-30m-morpeth-bypass-officially-12845748.amp}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Morpeth new St Leonard's Junction |url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/5042992}}</ref>
